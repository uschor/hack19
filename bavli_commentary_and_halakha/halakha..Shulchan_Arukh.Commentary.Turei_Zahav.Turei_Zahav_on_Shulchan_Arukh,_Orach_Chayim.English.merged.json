            "1. He should be strong as a lion. The most important strength is against the evil inclination, for they said, \"Who is strong etc.\" And the lion is chosen for the nature of the lion is that he fears no creature, as is written, \"It is not dismayed by their cries etc.\" Similarly, fear of the evil Inclination must not rise in Man, though it is stranger than him. ",
            "2.  That he should awaken etc. Seemingly (waking in the morning) is not related to this idea, rather it simply implies alacrity. So, the message is: you cannot compare one who is inspired by others to performs a mitzvah, with one who (sustains his internal inspiration to) perform on his own. Accordingly, it seems that we can explain what our master the Tur writes, \"I awaken the morning but the morning does not awaken me.\" Whereas (the Shulchan Aruch) omits the ending. Apparently, as we know, when a person sanctifies himself a bit on his own, heaven helps him to be sanctified more. The same is true regarding inspiration, that there are two kinds of inspiration. First one must inspire himself 'from below' (on his own) and afterwards additional inspiration is sent to him from above to help him. And this is what Kind David praised himself for that he was on such a level, ie. that his own inspiration was so intense that he did not need the helping inspiration from above. Therefor he he said, \"I awaken the morning.\" ... ... ... But this level belongs only to David and those like him. But as for us and those like us, we could only wish to merit even the inspiration 'from below\" that might cause the inspiration 'from above ' to come. For this reason the Shulchan Aruch mentions only that one must strengthen himself at  least that \"he should awaken the morning\" even if he will not merit the second level that we mentioned. "

Despite the fact that women are obligated in the mitzva of Megila, that case is different than our own. Regarding the reading of Megila, there are opinions that women do not make a blessing over the \"reading\" of Megila; rather, their blessing is over \"hearing\" Megila, as the Beit Yosef says there. Therefore, it would certainly be incorrect, ab initio, for them to discharge a man's obligation. That is not the case here, however, as all admit there is no distinction whatsoever between men and women..."
