For a person's way of sitting, his movements and his dealings while he is alone in his house are not like his way of sitting, his movements and his dealings when he is before a great king; nor are his speech and free expression as much as he wants when he is with his household members and his relatives like his speech when in a royal audience. All the more so when one takes to heart that the Great King, the Holy One, Blessed Is He, Whose glory fills the earth, is standing over him and watching his actions, as it is stated: \"'Will a man hide in concealment and I will not see him?' - the word of God\" (Jeremiah 23:24), he immediately acquires fear and submission in dread of God, May He Be Blessed, and is ashamed of Him constantly (Guide for the Perplexed III 52). And one should not be ashamed because of people who mock him in his service of God, and should also go modestly. And when he lies on his bed he should know before Whom he lies, and as soon as he wakes up from sleep he should rise eagerly to the service of his Creator, May He Be Blessed and Exalted (Tur).",

Others understand \"with wisdom\", that G-d arranged the food of Adam Harishon [before he was created] and afterwards he was created. \"And create in him holes, holes hollow places, hollow places\", meaning: many holes, for example mouth nose and anus, and also creates in him limbs with many hollow places, like the heart, belly and intestines. \"If one of them to shut up\", meaning: that in the places there are holes there is one hole, Which is the mouth, that when [one is inside his mother] he is closed off [dependent on mother for all needs does not need to use organs] and [if] when he goes into the air of the world it [his organs]  remain clogged, it would not be possible to remain alive even for one moment.

Therefore, since every one of them is doubled over to make two [strings], if two ends have torn off then the tzitzis are invalid, because it could be that one string has torn [at both ends]. According to our practice - which is to be carefule when making Tzitzis to place a mark on four of the ends in such a way that these four ends are always on the same side of the knot, and the four [doubled] ends are on the other side - if two ends tear off on the same side, the Tzitzis are still Kosher, because certainly these are two [different] strings, and each one still has its second end which is more than \"long enough to tie.\" Rabbeinu Tam only accepts [Tzitzis] in a case where two complete strings remain - meaning four ends which each have a full 12-knuckle length [which is required when making new tzitzis]. Therefore he will accept them even when the other two tzitzis have torn - if they still have \"enough to tie\" - but if three have torn, even though they still have \"enough to tie\", they are invalid. Because of this, when three ends have torn, if at the time the Tzitzis were made he was not careful to ensure recognition of the four ends that came from one side of the [initial] knot, we are concerned that perhaps every end comes from a different string, and therefore there is only one complete string left - so because of this doubt we must invalidate the Tzitzis. However, if only two ends have torn, they are Kosher if \"enough to tie\" remains. The law follows the first opinion [which said that even if three or four threads are torn off, the Tzitzis are still Kosher as long as we know that each one is a torn end of a different string]. However, it is good to be concerned for Rabbeinu Tam's opinion where possible. Rem\"a: Our custom is to follow Rabbeinu Tam.

            "A blessing must be recited before smelling a pleasant fragrance, but no blessing is recited afterward (216:1). The general blessing on fragrances is “…Who creates types of fragrances”; this blessing is recited on mixtures of fragrances of different types (217:1) or in cases of doubt as to which blessing is required. There are special blessings if the source of the fragrance is wood or a plant stem; a grass or flower; an edible plant substance such as fruit, provided it has a natural fragrance (see 216:5) and the intent is to smell it, not just to eat it (216:2); or an oil (216:4). For examples of these types of fragrances see 216:2-9,14; on precedence see 216:10-11. When incense is burned to produce a fragrance, the blessing should not be recited until it begins to smoke (216:12-13). No blessing is recited on a fragrance whose source is no longer present even if it can still be detected (216:6;217:3), or on a fragrance that was produced only to counteract a bad odor (see 217:2-3), or on a fragrance that comes from a forbidden source (see 217:4-7), or on a mixture of fragrances in which such components are in the majority (217:6)."

And likewise with anything that is pleasant for him in this world, his intent should not be for his pleasure, but rather for the service of the Creator, may He be blessed; as it is written (Proverbs 3:6), \"In all of your ways, know Him.\" And the Sages said, \"Let all of your actions be for the sake of Heaven.\" As even optional things – such as eating, drinking, walking, sitting, getting up, sexual relations and conversation – all of them should be for the service of your Creator or for something that enables serving Him. For even if one was thirsty or hungry – if he ate or drank for his pleasure, it is not praiseworthy. Rather he should intend to eat and drink for his sustenance, to serve his Creator. And likewise even to sit in the council of the righteous, to stand in the place of the saintly and to go in the path of the straight – if he does it for his own pleasure and to fulfill his desire, it is not praiseworthy; only when he does it for the sake of Heaven.

Rather even at a time when he is weary and needs to sleep in order to rest from his weariness – if he does [so] for the pleasure of his body, it is not praiseworthy. Rather he should intend to give sleep to his eyes and rest to his body for the requirements of health, so that his mind not get jumbled during Torah study on account of sleep deprivation. And likewise with sexual relations: Even at the time [prescribed] by the Torah, if he does [it] for the pleasure of his body, it is disgraceful. And even if his intent is in order that he will [produce] children that will serve him and take his place, it is not praiseworthy. Rather he should intend that he will [produce] children for the service of his Creator; or he should intend to fulfill the commandment of the [prescribed] time, like someone who is paying his debt. And likewise with conversation: Even to recount words of wisdom, his intent must be for the service of the Creator or for something that leads to serving Him. The principle of the matter [is that] one is obligated to put his eyes and his heart to his ways and evaluate all of his actions on the scales of his intellect: So when he sees something that will bring him to serving the Creator, may He be blessed, he should do it. But if not, he should not do it. And one who acts like this will be serving his Creator constantly."

            "1. The Laws of Kirah and a Tanur, placing pots on them on Erev Shabbos:  A Kirah is one which is constructed in the shape of a (large) kettle. Pots are placed on top of it, where it has its mouth, and there is room for placing two pots. If this Kirah was fired by means of Gefes [olive waste], or with wood, one may not place food on it to cook in the evening (on Erev Shabbos) with the intention of leaving it there (until after Shabbos arrives) – unless the food has already been fully cooked and is shrinking (i.e., continually getting bigger and smaller as a result from the cooking) to its detriment, in which case it need not be feared that the coals in the stove will be stirred. It is also permitted to place the pot on the stove if the food is raw, i.e. it has not been cooked at all. Since it is raw, one will not pay attention to it until the next morning, as it is can finish cook during the night without stoking the coals. However, if the food is cooked a little bit, or even if it is fully cooked but shrinking through cooking will benefit it, we are concerned that the coals might be stoked. Therefore, leaving it on the stove is forbidden unless the stove is raked, in other words, all the coals are removed from it or are covered with ashes, in other words the coals are covered with ashes to lessen the heat’s intensity. If a raw piece (of meat) is put into the pot, it is permitted just as if it would consist entirely of raw (meat), since now he will not pay attention to the entire pot. But even if the coals were not raked (meaning the coals were taken out of the oven) or covered with ashes (meaning the coals were covered with ashes) it is permitted to place a pot next to it, on the outside. If it was fired with straw or stubble, it is permitted to allow a pot to stay on it even if it was not Gerufa (raked from the stove) or Ketuma (the coals are covered with ashes). <i> RAMA: If two Kirah stoves are joined one beside the other, with an earthenware partition between them: if one is Gerufa or Ketuma and the second is not Gerufa or Ketuma, it is permitted to allow a pot to stay on the one which is Gerufa or Ketuma, even though the one which is not Gerufa or Ketuma will add to its heat. </i> However, as for a Tanur stove even if it was fueled by straw or stubble, it is forbidden to place (a pot) even adjacent to it – even if it is Garuf ve’katum <i> RAMA as long as it is Yad soledes bo. (Haga'ot Mordechai) </i> It goes without saying that it is forbidden to let a pot stay within it or on it. As for a Kupach-stove which has room for placing one pot on it, where it was fueled by straw or stubble, it has the status of a Kirah; where it was fueled by Gefes or wood, it has the status of a Tanur. <i>(Our types of ovens have the status of a Kirah) (R\"an).</i> And if he forgot and left it (on the stove) if it is a Tavshil that is cooked all the way it is permitted even if it is food that improves as it condenses (called 'Mitztamech v'Yafeh Lo'). But if it is a dish that is beginning to cook and is not cooked all the way it is forbidden until Motzei Shabbos. Where one deliberately leaves a pot of food, it is forbidden in both cases<i> RAMA: until a time period has elapsed (after Shabbos) during which the cooking done on Shabbos could be done (after Shabbos) (Ha'agahot Ashiri and Rambam). But if a Non-Jew puts it back on on Shabbos the law is the same as one who forgot and left it on (Ha'agahot Ashiri). And if a Jew puts it back on the law is the same as one who intentionally left it on. (Ha'agahot Mordechai). And if the food condensed through more cooking to its detriment it is permitted because he receives no benefit from the forbidden thing. (Beis Yosef, and see the beginning of Siman 237) </i> There are those who say that where it has already been cooked to the degree of <i>Ma’achal ben Derusa’i (i.e. the name of a thief who ate his food semi-cooked) </i> or it is completely cooked and further cooking will improve it, it is permitted to leave it on a Kirah. <i> RAMA: or even on a Tanur (HaMagid; Ha'agahot Mordechai; the beginning of the paragraph Kirah in the Beis Yosef) </i> even one fired with Gefes (olive waste) or wood, and even if it was not Gerufa or Ketuma. In this opinion, Garuf ve’katum and firing with straw and stubble were mentioned only when the cooking process has begun but has not reached the stage of <i>Ma’achal ben Derusa’i; </i>or, where one has removed the pot from the stove and desires to return it on Shabbos. Where one forgets and leaves a pot of food, which has begun to cook, but has not reached the stage of <i>Ma’achal ben Derusa’i </i>, it is forbidden to eat it. It goes without saying where one intentionally leaves it there that it is forbidden to eat.  <i>RAMA: The people’s custom is to be lenient and follow this last opinion </i>...........",

It is forbidden to return [a pot] to a Tanur even if it is raked and covered up. Similarly, a Kupach when fired with Gefes [olive waste] and wood. <i> RAMA: This is specifically when the food is fully cooked (Beis Yosef). It is then permitted to return it, even to another Kirah. But if it is not fully cooked it is forbidden even to return it to the same Kirah. There are those who say that all is forbidden only where one removes it from the Kirah while it is still day and wishes to return it after dark. However, if he removes it after dark it is permitted [to return] even if in the meantime he places it on the floor. (R\"an Perek Kirah). This is our custom to be lenient for our [type of] ovens, that have the status of a Kirah, because the lenient opinion is relied upon. And it is better to be more stringent. But in all opinions where it has cooled off it is forbidden [to return it] [Beis Yosef]. There are those who say that if one removes the food from the Tanur on Shabbos it is forbidden to wrap it up in pillows or blankets. There are those who say that close to dark or close to Barchu which for us constitutes an acceptance of Shabbos (Ha'agahot Mordechai), where it is so close to Shabbos that if the pot would be cool it would be impossible to boil it up while still day, the same law (of Chazora) applies as to Shabbos itself. Some are lenient in this, and such is the accepted practice. Nevertheless it would be  preferable to be stringent where there is no real need. But this refers only (to returning) directly onto a Kirah, however placing it next to it (the stove) or even next to a fire where the heat is Yad soledes bo is permitted even close to dusk. For a Tanur there is no difference between returning a pot onto it or next to it when that area is at a temperature of Yad soledes bo, but if that area is not Yad soledes it is permitted even on Shabbos, as will be stated below in Siman 318.</i>",

On Shabbos, it is permissible to place onto a pot of hot water, a dish of food that is already fully cooked such as Panades or the like, in order to warm it, since he is not cooking in a usual manner. However it is definitely forbidden to place (food) under cloths that cover a water kettle. <i> RAMA: similarly it is forbidden to place (food) on a Kirah even if it is Gerufa and Ketuma, as the sages only permitted Chazora (but not placing a pot for the first time), as has been explained above. Some (authorities) permit placing (a pot of food) into a Tanur used for baking on Erev Shabbos, when no food was left warming in it (it was merely used for baking on Erev Shabbos), only a small amount of heat remains and there need be no concern that this will cause it (the pot) to be cooked – provided (the food) has not cooled completely. Some, however, are stringent here, and (hold that) if the heat of the Tanur is so intense that it is of Yad soledes bo, it is forbidden. See below Siman 318. One may not tell a non-Jew to do anything that is forbidden to do himself. It is therefore forbidden to tell a non-Jew to heat up the pot (of food) that has cooled. If one does so, it is forbidden to eat it even cold. [Beis Yosef and the Teshuvos HaRashba] However, if the food has not cooled below the temperature at which it is edible, it may be eaten if the non-Jew heats it up. For this reason it is common practice to have non-Jews remove pots of food from ovens in which they have been stored to retain their heat, and place them next to or on top of a heating stove, and then have the (non-Jewish) maidservant light the stove, whereupon the food will become boiling hot once again. However it is forbidden to do this through a Jew. (Terumas HaDeshen) If, however, the pots are still hot they may be placed next to the heating stove. The reason is that, as has been explained, our ovens have a status of a Kirah, and placing it next to a Kirah, which is not Garuf Ve’katum, has the same law as placing directly on top of it when it is Garuf Ve’katum (which is permitted). It has already been stated that the customary practice is to be lenient (and permit) to do Chazora [returning a pot to the stove] even if the pot has been placed on the ground. Similarly, placing (a pot) next to an oven, which is not Garuf Ve’katum (is permitted) if the food is still hot and fully cooked. It is a widespread, accepted practice to permit this.

The Laws of Food Prepared Erev Shabbos in order to complete on Shabbos, containing 9 Seifim:  Although it is permitted to do She’hiya [leaving a pot on the stove over Shabbos] with raw meat, this refers to {meat cooked} in a pot, but placing meat for roasting next to a fire close to Shabbos is forbidden, since it it roasts quickly and one might stir the coals. However, this is only for beef or goat meat; but kid or fowl, cut up into sections, are permitted (to be placed next to a fire for roasting). We do not fear that the coals might be stirred, since such meat will burn (i.e., go beyond the stage of roast and become burned meat) if the coals are stirred, for they require no more than the heat of the fire. However, (if roasting is done) in an oven whose mouth is sealed with clay, then even a whole kid or fowl, as well as beef or goat meat are permitted. We need not fear that anyone will stir up the coals, for if the stove will be opened for stirring air will enter, cooling the stove and causing the meat to harden and spoil. <i> RAMA: There is no difference here whether it is completely raw or somewhat cooked.

There are some who are stringent and hold that everything is permitted in a stove that is sealed with clay, and, (on the other hand) everything is forbidden over an open fire. The distinction made between a kid and fowl and other meat, exists only where the mouth of the oven is closed but not sealed with clay.

Hatmana may not be done in a substance that adds heat, even while it is yet day (before Shabbos). If one did Hatmana in a substance that adds heat, the food is forbidden even after the fact.

However, in a way that the soft materials do not touch the pot, even though there is fire underneath them, it is permitted since this is not the normal manner for Hatmana. Therefore, where one places a pot on a Kirah or Kupach that contains coals, and the bottom of the pot does not touch the coals, it is called She’hiya and permitted according to the rules laid down in Siman 253. If one places a wide utensil over the pot in such a way that it overlaps the pot and then puts cloths over the wide utensil, this is permissible. Since the cloths do not touch the pot as the utensil is wider than the pot, it is not considered Hatmana. Similarly, it is permitted to place a pot into our ovens by putting a raw piece into it, provided that the pot is not touching the coals.

Rather, he should shake the cover and it will fall (on its own) e.g, its muktzah is uncovered, and this is not considered 'moving'. However, if it was insulated with fleece wool, even if it was not designated for that purpose, it is permitted to move it. This refers to fleece that is not set aside for commerce. However if they are for merchandise they must be set aside. If one insulates with them without them being set aside, one shakes the cover and they fall off, that is to say, when the cover of the pot is considered as a k’li. Even though they are on top of it, we are not worried about it, because we do not make a Basis for them.",

For as long as they are not designated for that purpose, they are not considered important to a person and he may cast them away. Therefore, it would be forbidden to move them if they were not set aside and designated for that purpose",

When a person insulated [a pot of food] in a container full of muchin that are forbidden to be moved, once he removed the pot from there in the prescribed manner, he may return it there, as long as the hollow [in which the pot had been placed] remains intact. If, however, the hollow did not remain intact, it is forbidden to return it. Nevertheless, as an initial preference, one may remove the pot with the intent of returning it, [provided the hollow remains intact]. We are not concerned that he may widen the hollow if it does not remain intact. There are those who say that even if one insulates with a substance that is permissible to move, if the hollow remains intact one may not return it, because the pot would need to have a place made for itself to be grasped, as we find regarding one who insulates on Shabbat.",

If it is possible to have a minor Jew do it, an adult Jew should not do it. If it is not possible, then an adult can do it in a slightly different manner than usual, and this is our custom. And it seems to me that it is permitted to return it and seal the over, in other words during the day, for then all the pots have been cooking like they have needed. However at night, close to the time he insulates it - for there is a doubt that maybe the pots have not yet cooked fully - it is forbidden to seal the oven because one will cause [the food] to cook more quickly as is explained in Siman 257 Seif 4.

This is a decree [enacted by our Sages] lest she be [required] to immerse herself [in the mikveh]on Shabbos. If she would be granted license to go out wearing these strands or strips, she might also go to the mikveh while [wearing] them. We are concerned lest she walk 4 amos in the public domain. If the strands and straps are braided into her hair, she is permitted to go out wearing them. There is one [opinion] who forbids this. If the strands are (hollow and formed like a net) ([and] woven) it is permitted because she would not be required to remove them during immersion. <i>RAMA: And also so they will not be soiled or gilded, because in that instance as well, she is careful to remove them before immersion so that the mud will not dissolve in the water [and soil her body when she emerges from her immersion]. </i>",
            "2. A woman is allowed to go out [wearing] strands wound around her neck which are loose, and she is not required to remove them at the time of immersion. However, [going out] with a choker is forbidden because she must remove it at the time of immersion; [Why?] since she “chokes” herself with this strap in order to appear plump. (Note: In that era, it was considered attractive for a woman to appear plump. Some explain the rationale: Hunger was prevalent and being well-fed was a sign of prestige). And we worry that maybe she will travel little by little 4 amos in the public domain. Similarly, a woman should not go out wearing a totefes. [That term refers to an ornament] like a forehead plate that extends from ear to ear. Nor may she go out with a sharvitin. This is also a type of headband wrapped around her head, [with strands] hanging down on her cheeks from both sides. The restriction applies provided these strands are not sewn into her hairnet, for then there is room for concern that she might remove them to show to her friends and walk thusly 4 amos in the public domain. By contrast, there is no such concern if [the strands] are sewn into her hairnet, for she will certainly not remove them together with her hairnet, so as not to reveal her hair. (Note: For a married woman’s hair is considered as “nakedness” (Berachos 24a). Uncovering it is a sign of immodesty (Kesubos 72a). <i>RAMA: And there are those who say that regarding an unmarried woman, who is not concerned about her hair being uncovered, it is forbidden to go [wearing such strands] even if they are sewn to her hairnet, because it is possible that she will remove them [together] with the hairnet to display their beauty and afterwards forget [that it is Shabbos]and carry them by hand.</i>",

This refers to the members of the household in which the fire is because there is concern that because they are panicked, while they are saving food they will forget that it is Shabbat and will put out the fire. However, nearby houses that are worried that fire will reach them are permitted to save as much food as they want.",
            "2. There are some who permit carrying money and other things that are muktzeh in order to save them from the fire or from bandits coming to rob them, because in a case of financial loss, we do not worry about the prohibition of muktzeh. There are those who forbid this. There is even one who forbids telling a non-Jew to carry business items that will be destroyed by the rain. (See above Chapter 307 Paragraph 19.)",
            "3. If one saves bread made of fine flour he cannot go back to save bread made of course flour (meaning bread whose splendor is gone, meaning bran-flour bread), but the opposite is allowed [meaning that if he saved course bread, he can return to save the fine bread.]",
            "4. We save food from a fire on Yom Kippur for Shabbat, but not from a fire on Shabbat for Yom Kippur or a Festival, nor do we save food from a fire on Shabbat for the next Shabbat. However, we save one meal's worth of food from a fire on Yom Kippur for after Yom Kippur.",
            "5. We save the same amount of food for a sick person, an old person, and a glutton as we do for an average person.",
            "6. The three meal limit is limited to when you would use multiple containers to increase the number of meals, but one is allowed to save even one hundred meals if it is in one container. One is allowed to use his garment and fold it to collect multiple things as long as he takes it all out at once.",

            "11.  Some say that all of these rules only apply to a yard or entrance adjacent to the public domain that have no roof and are therefore similar to the public domain. Therefore, we are only allowed to save three meals and necessary utensils. However, to a different house that is within an enclosure, one is permitted to remove as much as he wants. Regarding removing things to a courtyard, the restrictions only apply to removing things to another courtyard, but his own courtyard requires no eruv and he is permitted to remove as much as he want to it. Some reject this distinction.",

In these days, all holy scriptures are saved from a fire and read from [publicly], even if they are written in any language and even if they are written with dye or red paint (meaning types of paint) or anything else. Similarly, a set of blessings that the Sages established [i.e., a siddur] should be saved from a fire or from any \"turpah\" (meaning an open and vulernable place). Similarly, a translation written in Hebrew like \"Yagar Shahaduta\" [Genesis 31:47] or \"Thus shall you say to them\" [Jeremiah 10:11, in Aramaic], or Hebrew written in Aramaic or in another language that the people are proficient in, or a Torah scroll that has 85 letters part of full words or has the name of God; all of these are saved.",

            "17. Some allow one to save a pouch full of money from the fire or from burglars and robbers by putting it on a loaf of bread or a baby. This can only be done to the private domain but not to a non-enclosed courtyard (books may be saved even to a non-enclosed courtyard) or to an entrance (meaning a place where people enter courtyards) that are not adjoined. There must be three walls and a stake serving as a fictitious partition.",

Additional, one is permitted to make a wall of objects to stop the fire from spreading, even clay jugs full of water that will definitely explode when the fire reaches them, as indirectly putting out a fire is permitted. Rem\"a: in the case of monetary loss (Mordechai in Perek Kol Kitvei).",
            "23. If a garment has caught on fire, one may spread it out and cover himself with it and needn't worry that it will be extinguished. There is one who says that he must not intend for it to go out. Rem\"a: It is permitted to put a dish over a candle so that the beam will not catch fire (Tur. And see above Chapter 277 Paragraph 5).",
            "24. Some say that one may not put drinks [on a garment that is on fire] so that the fire will go out when it gets to them. There are also some who permit this with all drinks except for water, because water would be like washing the garment, [which is forbidden]. And there are some who allow even water. The second opinion appears reasonable.",
            "25. If a non-Jew comes to put out the fire, it is not necessary to stop him. However, if a child comes to put out the fire, it is necessary to stop him.",
            "26. One is permitted to say in front of a non-Jew \"Whoever puts out this fire won't lose!\" Even if the non-Jew isn't there, he may be summoned, even though it is certain that he will put out the fire when he comes. This holds for all similar situations of damage, like if a wine barrel is cracked, one may call a non-Jew even though it is certain that he will fix it when he comes. Rem\"a: All of the laws regarding a fire only apply to their day, but in our day when we live surrounded by non-Jews and there is potentially fatal danger, the Rishonim and Acharonim z\"l wrote that one is permitted to extinguish a fire on Shabbat because lives are in danger, and one who hurries to do this is praised. In any event, everything is by the situation, for if it is certain that there is no danger, it is forbidden to extinguish. But if there is a chance of danger, it is permitted to put out even a fire in a non-Jew's house, and such is the practice (Trumat Hadeshen Chapter 58 and Hagahot Ashr\"i Perek Mi SheHotziuhu in the name of the Or Zarua). This applies specifically to putting out the fire, which is work not done for the sake of the object on which the work is being done and there is danger if you do not put it out, but it is forbidden to desecrate Shabbat in order to save (money), and if one sinned and desecrated, he must fast forty days on Monday and Thursday, and he may not drink wine or eat meat, and he should give eighteen pshitim to charity in the place of a sin-ofering. If he wants to avoid the fast, he must give twelve pshitim to charity for each day (Piskei Mahara\"i Chapter 60) and see the Tur Yoreh Deah from the Laws of Niddah Chapter 185.",

If he uses one container, he can even save one hundred meals. He may also tell others, \"Come and save for yourselves.\" He cannot sponge it, meaning putting a sponge near the wine to drip it out, this being a rabbinic enactment lest he come to squeeze it, [a prohibited labor]. This is true even if the sponge has a handle to avoid the problem of squeezing, because he should not do this the way he would do it on a weekday. One may not dab up oil, dipping his fingers in it and rubbing it off on the sides of a container [so that the oil runs down the sides and is thereby collected]. Rem\"a: There are some who restrict this to a broken barrel, because in that case, he is panicked, and if he is allowed to save its contents we fear that he will fix it. However, if it is cracked and slowly dripping, he is less panicked, and is allowed to save the contents in containers, collecting and combining (Hagahot Mordechai and Tosafot Perek Kol Kitvei and Hagahot Maimoni Chapter 22). There are some who say that this all refers to saving food from one yard to another, but to another house that is enclosed with his house, he may save everything, as has been explained above regarding fires (Piskei Mahara\"i Chatper 196).",

If a barrel on the roof broke, he can bring a container and put it underneath, as long has he doesn't bring an additional container to collect the liquid in the air that fell off the roof and another container to connect to the roof. If he's using one container, it is allowed even to collect in the air or to attach to the roof.",
            "3. If he has guests, he can take an additional container to collect the liquid in the air and to attach to the roof, but he shouldn't do these things and then invite guests, nor should he treat this as a loophole, inviting guests who don't need to eat. Rem\"a: However, if he sinned and did such, collecting and then inviting guests, it is permitted (Ramban and the Magid Chapter 22).",
            "4. If wine flows from grapes in a tub that had not yet been pressed, the droppings are not usable because the drinks that flowed out are forbidden, and therefore he is not permitted to put a dish underneath because he will disqualify the dish from being used for other purposes, [as it would now contain something forbidden]. What should he do? He should put his bed or table underneath, and then the droppings will be like a chamber pot [i.e., disgusting], and then he can put a container to collect them in order to not make a mess. When the container fills up, he should not throw the contents into another container and thus disqualify that container from use. Rather, he should empty it back into the tub which it came from, for the tub is already disqualified from use because of the drinks in it and the drinks that flowed from it.",

This is a rabbinic decree lest one come to climb the tree and pick something from it. If someone climbed a tree on Shabbat by mistake, he is permitted to descend. If he did it on purpose, he is not allowed to descend. If he climbed the tree when it was still day on Friday, he is always allowed to descend after it gets dark. There are some who say that this only applies when it was his intention to descend while it was still day, but if it was not his intention to descend while it was still day, he should not descend when it gets dark, as he intended to sit in a forbidden place. Rem\"a: This only applies to a person who ascended the tree, but if he left an object there while it is still day, it is forbidden for him to remove it from there on Shabbat (Magaid Chapter 21). All of this applies to a tree or the like, but one is permitted to use reeds that are soft like an herb, even if they are connected to the ground, because there is no prohibition against using herbs (Hagahot Oshr\"i Perk Bechol Me'arvin in the name of the Or Zarua and Beit Yosef).",

If they are less than that height, one is permitted to use them, because they are considered as if they were ground. If they slope downwards, they are forbidden where they are taller than three and permitted where they are shorter than three. If they are three [tefachim] tall with empty space below them, even though on one side of them there isn't empty space and they are level with the ground, it is forbidden to sit even on the side that is level with the ground.",

Even though this is not their intention, it is an unavoidable consequence (\"psik reisha\") of their action. However, it is permitted to urinate on them or to dispense other liquids that do not make the plants grow.

If such had been done, as was explained in paragraph 2, it is permitted, but otherwise it is considered a non-enclosed yard, as will be explained below in chapter 357. And see below chapter 376 paragraph 4 (Rama's own opinion). All of this is initially, but afterwards if they forgot to make an eruv, this is allowed because of the importance of human dignity (Hagahot Mordechai and his own opinion). Those who use boats go to the bathroom from the paddle wheel to the sea. Because it is not ten tall, even though it is four wide, it is karmelit, and it is considered moving something from karmelit to karmelit (Beit Yosef in the name of Orchot Hayim).</i>",

If there are two balconies, one above the other, [or even] a bit offset but not four [horizontal] tefachim away from each other, whether they have ten [vertical] tefachim between them or more, if they jointly made walls for the top one [in order to be allowed to draw water from below the balcony], it is forbidden for either of them [to draw water] until they make an eruv. This is even more true if they jointly made walls for the bottom one. However, if one made walls for his balcony independently, the other does not render it forbidden, even if it doesn't have walls. Similarly, if they both jointly made walls for both, one balcony's existence does not render the other forbidden for use."

At least one tefach of the wall must be underwater. If the whole wall is underwater, at least one tefach must be above the water. If one started to make a wall from the sides of the stream but did not connect the walls so that water can still flow, if there are three tefachim between the sides, this is allowed, and we consider it attached.

            "1.<b> The Laws of a Yard that is Narrower than Four Amot and a Drain, 3 Seifim:</b>  If a yard is smaller than four by four amot and is adjacennt to the public domain, we do not pour water into it on Shabbat in the summer. Because it is not four [by four] amot, two seah of water that someone would use everyday cannot be contained by the yard, and it is as if he pours water to the public domain. Therefore, it is necessary to make a pit that will be able to hold two seahs of water. <i>RAMA: Every pit that is one half amah by one half amah and three-fifths amah deep can hold two seah (Ramba\"m).</i> This is true whether he makes the pit in the yard or outside. If he makes it outside, he must cover it with boards to make it a place of exemption, and therefore the water will be falling from his hand to a place of exemption. Once he makes the pit, he can pour as much as he wants in. If it doesn't hold two seahs, he may not pour anything. If the yard is four by four square amot, even if [this square amot count is fulfilled in a yard that is] exceptionally long or wide, or if it is winter, one is permitted to pour as much water as he likes. A yard and an exedra (meaning a house with three walls, and the fourth wall that would have the door does not fully enclose the the house. Sometimes there are columns every amah, according to the Aruch, and columns are bits of walls that are straight and even) that individually are not four [by four square] amot can join together to complete this four [by four square] amot area and allow pouring in it. <i>RAMA: This is the case for two upper-level rooms that are in front of two chambers that have a ceiling that can hold water. If they are adjacent to one another, they can be combined for this purpose (Beit Yosef in the name of Rabbenu Yonatan).</i> What are we talking about? When a yard is adjacent to the public domain, but if it is adjacent to the karmelit, even if it is tiny, it doesn't need a pit even in the summer (and see below chapter 377).",
            "2. If a drain is covered for four amot in the public domain and it is four by four, it is permitted to pour water into the drain even in the summer, even though the water travels from your hand to the outside. This is true as long as the drain is not wooden because such a drain cannot hold enough. But if it is made of stone, it is allowed. The Ramba\"m says that even if the drain or pipe is 100 amot long, one should not pour into it during the summer; rather, one should pour just outside of it and the water will descend into the drain.",
            "3. What are the parameters? The water must be exiting to the public domain, but if it exits to the karmelit, it is permitted to pour into the drain even during the summer. <i>RAMA: There are those who say that there is no distinction between the karmelit and the public domain (Beit Yosef in the name of the Tosafot and the Ros\"h in Chapter Keitzad Mishtatfin). This is only with regards to a karmelit that is inside the city, because it is similar to the public domain, even in our day when there is no public domain. However, a karmelit outside of the city or a non-enclosed yard is permitted (Mordechai Chapter Hazorek and the Sma\"g and his own opinion) (Responsa of the Mahara\"m chapter 90). If a city is surrounded by a wall but has no eruv, it is treated like a non-enclosed yard (Mordechai at the end of Chapter HaDar and Trumat HaDeshen chapter 73 and 74). If the pipe is higher than ten [tefachim off the ground] such that the water passes through the place of exemption to the karmelit, one should be lenient (Mahari\"l), and this is the position to be followed.</i>"

However, if it is two seot big, which is seven amot and four tefachim by seven amot by four tefachim, it is permitted to carry within it, whether it is square, round, long, or wide, as long as its length is not more than twice its width. If it is enclosed for dwelling, even if it includes a few mils, it is permitted to carry within all of it. <i>RAMA: And see below chapter 401 regarding whether generic cities are enclosed for dwelling. There are some who say that generic porches are enclosed for dwelling, because generally they are built and then enclosed (Mordechai Chapter Osin Pasin). And there are furthermore those who say that any porch attached to the house is considered enclosed for dwelling, because such was his intention (Hagahot Oshr\"i on Chapter 2 of Eiruvin), and some disagree (Beit Yosef in the name of the Tosafot).</i>",

If it was enclosed not for dwelling and one wants to enclose it for dwelling, he doesn't need to destroy the whole wall. Rather, he should make a breach bigger than ten [amot], and then the house will be open to a non-enclosed area. Then he can return and patch up the whole wall or just leave ten open and that ten is considered an opening. This way, it was open and is now enclosed [newly, and considered enclosed for dwelling]. If he breached one amah and then patched it, and then breaks an adjacent amah and patches it, and so on until he gets to ten, this is permitted. <i>RAMA: If it is difficult for him to break the wall, some say that he can put dirt next to the wall from both sides until the wall becomes less than ten [tefachim] tall and the width of the dirt is from four amot [up] for the length of ten amot along the wall. If the dirt is not ten [tefachim] tall, it will be as if he broke the wall, because there are not ten tefachim above the ground, and it is considered the ground of the yard. Even if he returns and removes the dirt, because it was nullified for one Shabbat, [it still holds].

In places where they observe two days of Yom Tov, the shiva begins on the second day of the end of the festival, even if no mourning is observed then; because this day is only rabbinic, it counts towards the shiva, and one only counts six days following it. <i>Rem\"a: Regarding whether the second day of Rosh Hashanah counts towards the shiva, see glosses on Yoreh Deah 399:13.</i>",

One who buries his dead [relative] on the second day of yontif in the Diaspora that is the last day of the festival or the second day of Shavuot should observe mourning practices if that day is both the day of death and the day of burial. Because the second day of yontif is a rabbinic obligation and the first day of mourning is a Torah obligation, a rabbinic commandment can be superseded by a Torah commanded. However, if he was buried on the second day of Rosh Hashanah, we do not observe mourning practices because the two days are considered one long day.<i> Rem\"a: There are those who disagree and hold that one should not observe any mourning practices on the second day of yontif, and this is the widespread practice that should not be changed (Rabbeinu Hananel and the Rosh).</i>",

This is only applicable when one observed mourning in that hour.

[It is also permissible] if it was purchased with that intent from a craftsman, because [he] makes mats without any specific intent, seeking to sell them to whoever needs them, each person for his own particular need. Therefore, it is the purchaser’s intent at the time of acquisition that defines its purpose.

Moreover, even as an initial and preferred option, it is permitted to rest the s’chach itself on the walls of the sukkah even though they are made of materials that are invalid as s’chach, as is the case with a stone wall. [The rationale is that] there is no need to ordain such [a safeguard] for fear that someone might use stones as s’chach; everyone knows that stones are invalid as s’chach, for this would not be a sukkah at all, but a kind of permanent dwelling. Similarly, [even] as an initial and preferred option, it is permitted to attach the beams — on which the s’chach rests — to the walls of the sukkah with iron nails or tie them with pieces of cloth that are susceptible to ritual impurity. [This is permitted,] because the s’chach itself is placed on beams which are not susceptible to ritual impurity and which are valid as s’chach.",
            "The Sages ordained that any flat wooden objects of minimal width on which something could be placed, such as a table, a spade, or a baker’s trowel, are susceptible to ritual impurity, because they resemble receptacles. Therefore, they may not be used as s’chach, nor may they be laid on the s’chach to hold it in place, even if they are broken. Since there was a time when they were susceptible to ritual impurity, it was ordained [that they should never be used for s’chach].",
            "All the accessories to food — such as the straw of ears of grain, the twigs to which grapes [are attached], and the branches to which dates [are attached] — are susceptible to ritual impurity at the time they are attached to the food. [This concept is derived as follows:] From the verse, “It shall be impure for you,” the Sages inferred that anything that is necessary for you with regard to this food, i.e., [even] the accessories, is susceptible to ritual impurity like the food itself. The term “accessory” is applied only to [a maximum of] three handbreadths of the straw of ears of grain that belong to the kinds that are harvested with a sickle; four handbreadths of date branches; and two handbreadths of the twigs to which grapes [are attached], i.e., one handbreadth to the right of the cluster [of grapes] that hangs from the branch and one handbreadth to the left. If the branches are longer than these measures, all that is susceptible to ritual impurity is the part that is within these [maximum] distances from the food. ([Different rules apply with regard to] the straw of ears of grain that belong to those varieties that are not harvested with a sickle, but are uprooted by hand. Their definition as “accessories” is not limited by their length; even if they are very long, they are considered as “accessories” and are susceptible to ritual impurity.)",
            "Therefore, [the following law applies if] a person covered his sukkah with the straw of ears of grain, twigs to which grapes [are attached], and branches [laden] with dates. If the straw, the twigs, and the branches are not long enough to constitute a majority when compared to the food and to [that part of the straw, twigs, or branches that is considered] its “accessory,” [the s’chach] is invalid. When does the above apply? When the grain was reaped or the fruit was harvested for food. In such a situation, the “accessory” must be connected to the food so that the food can be held. If, by contrast, one reaped or harvested [the grain or the fruit] for the purpose of s’chach, he is not happy to have the “accessory” connected to the food, for the food will disqualify his sukkah. The “accessory” is therefore not susceptible to ritual impurity, for it is [ordinarily] susceptible to ritual impurity only because it is a subordinate auxiliary to food, and hence is considered to be like the food itself. In this instance, by contrast, the food is not at all needed for use as s’chach, and that was the purpose for which this person reaped. Hence, the “accessory” is not considered as subordinate to [the food. That part of the straw and the twigs that is considered as] an “accessory” therefore combines with the remainder of the length of the straw and the twigs to make the food batel — insignificant and therefore nullified — vis-à-vis the majority [of valid s’chach].",
            "If at the outset, a person harvested and reaped [the grain or fruit] with the intent of using them for food, and then changed his mind, and decided to use [the branches] for s’chach, his [change of] intent does not change the status of the accessories and remove their susceptibility to ritual impurity. [To do that,] he must do something to them that indicates that when he reaped or harvested, it was with the intent of using them for s’chach and not for food; e.g., he must thresh them with mallets or with animal hooves.",
            "Any [plant] that is primarily used as animal fodder and is consumed by humans only for medicinal purposes, such as finugee, which is called shumar in Arabic, may be used for s’chach as an initial and preferred option.",
            "If one used for s’chach vegetables that will dry within seven days, and their leaves will fall, leaving open space, [the leaves] are considered from the outset as if they have [already] fallen, even though they have not yet dried. Hence, [an area of] three handbreadths of them – even if they are at the side [of the sukkah] – disqualifies the sukkah as empty space would, as will be explained in sec. 632.48 Though they are susceptible to ritual impurity they are not considered as invalid s’chach, which does not disqualify the sukkah unless there are four handbreadths of it in the midst of the s’chach. [The rationale is that] since ultimately [the leaves] will wilt and fall in the course of the festival, they are not considered as s’chach. It is as if they do not exist.",
            "One may not use a substance that is [still] connected to the ground as s’chach,1 because it does not resemble “the remnants of the threshing floor and the winepress,” which have been detached from the ground.[Moreover,] if one covered a sukkah with [branches] that were connected [to the ground] and then detached [them], [the s’chach] is invalid. [This is derived from] the verse, “Make the Sukkos festival....” [Implied is that] one must make [the sukkah], and not [use] something which was already made in an unacceptable manner. Since the sukkah was originally made in an unacceptable manner, it is not considered to have been made at all. It is as if nothing was done. The fact that one later made the sukkah valid by detaching the tree [from the ground] is not considered as performing an action, for nothing new was done to the s’chach; i.e., he did not undo [his previous action] at all. Therefore there is no way to correct [such a sukkah] unless one moves about all the invalid s’chach that was detached; i.e., one must lift it up slightly and then put it down again. For at the time it was lifted, the first act — [putting it in place] when it was invalid — was nullified. When he now puts it in place, he is doing something new to the sukkah itself.",
            "There are certain substances that our Sages forbade using as s’chach as an initial preference. Among them are: [a] grasses with an unpleasant smell, [which are invalid] even though they are not edible and are not susceptible to ritual impurity; and also [b] certain kinds of brambles whose leaves fall at all times, even when there is no wind.[The rationale is that] we are apprehensive that a person may leave the sukkah because of the unpleasant smell or because of the falling leaves. Nevertheless, if one transgressed and used these materials as s’chach, [the sukkah] is valid and one may dwell in it as an initial and preferred option.",
            "Bundles of straw or bundles of wood may not be used for s’chach while they are bound together. [The rationale is that] on any summer evening a person will sometimes come from the fields with his bundle on his shoulder and place it to dry on the sukkah that he uses throughout the summer for his herds. [Thus he will] not [have placed it there] for the purpose of shade. When Sukkos comes, he will change his mind [and desire to use it] for s’chach. [This is not acceptable,] for [with regard to the sukkah] the Torah states, “Make [the Sukkos festival...].” [Implied is that] one must make [the sukkah], and not [use] something that was already made in an unacceptable manner. Now, this bundle was not placed there for s’chach, [nor] even for shade, but to dry. Hence, it is not considered as s’chach and this sukkah will have been made in an unacceptable manner. The Sages therefore ordained that bundles should never be used as s’chach even when they were placed on the sukkah in order to fulfill the mitzvah of sukkah for the festival. This ordinance [is a safeguard to forestall the possibility of error] involving bundles [that may have been placed there] throughout the summer.",
            "Since this prohibition was enacted only because of this ordinance, it was necessary to prohibit [the use of] only bundles [of the kind] which are commonly left to dry out, i.e., which have no fewer than 25 canes in them. Bundles of fewer than 25 canes may be used as s’chach.",
            "[Moreover,] even if there are 25 or more canes coming out of one stem, but they are separate at the other end and bound together there, they may be used as s’chach, for since they [emerge from] the same stem, they do not resemble a bundle that is left to dry. If, however, a person tied one cane that did not emerge from the same stem together with them, it is considered as [such] a bundle if there are 25 canes together with the additional one, and it may not be used as s’chach.",
            "2As to canes that are bound together in bundles to be sold in the marketplace by number, a purchaser unties them as soon as he buys them. One may [therefore] use them as s’chach. The ordinance forbidding the use of bundles bound throughout the summer months is not applied [in this context], because such a bundle is not ordinarily set aside while bound. [Even one who] purchases it to dry out [the wood] unties it immediately.",
            "[The following law applies to] bundles of willow branches whose thick ends are tied together at one extremity and whose thin ends are tied together at the other. As soon as one unties the knot at the thick end, [the bundle] may be used as s’chach, because the knot at the [thin] end is not so strong that it will hold if the bundle is carried. And any bundle that is not fit to be carried while bound is not considered a bundle at all.",
            "If [such] a bundle was tied only in the middle, it may not be used as s’chach, because it could be carried when bound in this way.",
            "If one transgressed and used a bundle as s’chach, he may untie [it] and thus [render the s’chach] valid. Though the sukkah was originally made in an unacceptable manner, it should not be disqualified because of [the above requirement to] “make, rather than [use] what was already made in an unacceptable manner.” [This leniency is granted] because [bundles are] deemed invalid only by Rabbinic ordinance, as explained above. If, however, one placed a bundle [on the sukkah] to dry, and when Sukkos arrived he changed his mind and decided to use it for s’chach, it is invalid by Scriptural Law, for it was not put there for shade. Hence, untying it is not sufficient to render it valid. [The rationale is that] it was not disqualified merely because it was tied together; rather, the fact that it was not laid in place for shade caused it to be disqualified by Scriptural Law. Something new must therefore be done to [the way] it was laid down. It must be lifted up slightly and then put back in place with the intent that it provide shade. The bundle must also be untied, for a bundle may not be used as s’chach because of the [safeguard] that was ordained [to forestall the possibility of error] involving a bundle [that may have been placed there] throughout the summer, as was explained above.",
            "Boards that are [at least] four handbreadths wide may not be used as s’chach, because the ceilings of most homes are made of [such boards]. Thus, [were they to be used,] there would be cause for concern that someone might sit under the ceiling of his home and say, “What difference is there between covering my sukkah with such boards — and sitting under the ceiling of my home? It, too, is made of boards!” And the ceiling of a home is invalid [as s’chach] according to Scriptural Law, for the reason explained in sec. 626.64",
            "Even if one did not place the width of the boards on the sukkah, but turned them and laid them on their sides, which were less than four handbreadths wide, they are, nevertheless, invalid. Once they have been deemed invalid, they are like metal spits that are invalid as s’chach, regardless of which way they are turned.",
            "However, boards that are less than four handbreadths wide may be used as s’chach even if they have been planed and resemble utensils, despite the fact that they are wide enough to be fit for use as seats [and] are also fit to have fruit and loaves placed on them. Nevertheless, they are not susceptible to ritual impurity, for they were not set aside to be sat upon nor to be used for any other purpose, but are intended for construction or for destroying a building.",
            "Today, when homes are roofed by boards that are less than three handbreadths wide, a sukkah should be disqualified even if boards less than three handbreadths wide are used as s’chach, because of the [safeguard] that was ordained lest one sit under the ceiling of his home that is made of such boards. However, one may use very narrow boards, such as lattices and shingles, for it is not common to make the ceiling of a home out of such narrow boards. Nevertheless, one must be careful to make the s’chach temporary and light so that rain can penetrate [the sukkah], as stated in sec. 631[:5]. It has therefore become customary not to use [boards] for s’chach at all, lest someone err and [build] a permanent [roof] that rain could not penetrate.",
            "In a pressing situation, where people lack materials to use as s’chach, one may use boards as s’chach, even if they are [more than] four handbreadths wide, if there is no other alternative.

And even if the household members are many, they should not kindle more. Rem\"a: And some say that every one of the household members kindles (Maimonides) and such is the widespread custom.

(Hagahot Maimoniot quoting Sefer Mitzvot Katan) It is permitted to kindle with candlesticks, since each light is separated greatly from the other. (Terumat Hadeshen Section 105) One must be careful when preparing lights, even of wax, not to stick them together and kindle them, since that is like a bonfire.

If there is a courtyard in front of the house, he should place it at the entrance of the courtyard. If he lives in the upper floor, having no entrance leading to the public domain, he should place it at a window that adjoins the public domain. In a time of danger, when one is not allowed to perform mitzvot, it is enough that he place it on his table. He needs another light to use for its illumination. And if there is a bonfire, he needs no other light. But if he is a dignified person, whose way is not to use the illumination of a bonfire, he needs another light.",

But if he placed it above ten handsbreadths, he has fulfilled his obligation. However, if he placed it above twenty cubits, he has not fulfilled his obligation. Rem\"a: And even if he took it as it is, lit, and placed it below twenty cubits, he has not fulfilled his obligation, because the kindling accomplishes the mitzvah. (Beit Yosef quoting Tosafot)",
            "It is a mitzvah to place [the Hanukkah light] in the handsbreadth closest to the entrance on the left, so as to have the mezuzah on the right and the Hanukkah light on the left. But if there is no mezuzah in the entrance, he should place [the Hanukkah light] on the right. If one places it in the doorway itself, he should place it on the leftmost half of the entrance. <i> Rem\"a: However nowadays, when all kindle inside, and there is no distinction for the people of the public domain at all, one should not worry so much if we do not kindle it in the handsbreadth closest to the entrance. In any case, the custom is to kindle it in the handsbreadth closest to the entrance, as in [our ancestors'] days, and one should not deviate; unless the household members are many, [in which case] it is preferable for each one to kindle in a unique place rather than mixing the lights together, with no distinction of the number of lights they are kindling. In any case, they should take care not to kindle in the same place where they kindle lights all year, since then there would be no distinction at all. And even though there is only no distinction except for the members of the household, some distinction at least is necessary.</i> In the synagogue, one should place [the Hanukkah light] at the southern wall (or to the south of the lamp, and he should arrange them from east to west). (Terumat Hadeshen Section 104, Beit Yosef) We kindle and recite the benedictions (in the synagogue) for the sake of publicizing the miracle. <i> Rem\"a: A person does not fulfill his obligation with the lights of the synagogue, and needs to kindle again in his own house. (Isaac ben Sheshet Section 111) We have the custom to kindle in the synagogue between the afternoon prayer and the evening prayer. Some have the custom to kindle on the Sabbath Eve before the afternoon prayer. (Kol Bo and Book of Abudirham) If [the prayer leader] wants to quickly pray right away after [he] has recited the benedictions and kindled one of them, the synagogue attendant may kindle the rest, and the prayer leader may pray. (Jacob ben Moses Moelin) </i>",
            "A courtyard having two entrances on two sides, [the owner] needs to kindle [Hanukkah lights] at both, because of suspicion [that he did not light]. But if both entrances are on the same side (and belong to the same house) (Kol Bo), one of them is enough for him. Rem\"a: When one kindles at two entrances, he only recites the benedictions by one of them, and kindles the second without a benediction (Nissim of Gerona). However, nowadays, when all kindle actually inside and there is no distinction for the people of the public domain at all, even if a courtyard or house has many entrances on many sides, we kindle only once inside; so it seems to me and so is the widespread custom."

            "Sobre los aceites y mechas aptos para Janucá. Y en él 4 incisos: Todos los aceites y todas las mechas son aptas para la vela de Janucá, lo anterior es a pesar de que hay aceites que no son absorbidos por la mecha, y cuya luz no se mantiene [tan incandescente] sobre las mismas mechas. REMÁ: De todos modos, el Aceite de Oliva, es una Mitzvá más elevada. [Esto basado en una antigua costumbre en la que se elevaba el uso de aceite de oliva por sobre otros, dada sus múltiples propiedades y su uso en tiempos bíblicos]. Sin embargo, en caso de que no sea posible encontrar aceite de oliva, la Mitzvá puede ser cumplida con aceitas cuya luz es pura y limpia. Al mismo tiempo acostumbramos en nuestras ciudades a encender [las velas de Janucá] con cera, pues su luz es clara como en el aceite.  Incluso en la víspera del Shabbat que acaece dentro de los días de Janucá, se pueden encender las velas de Jánuca con los aceites y las mechas con las que está prohibido encender las velas de Shabbat. REMÁ: Siempre y cuando no ponga en la vela, sino la cantidad suficiente como para cumplir con la Mitzvá. (Teshuvot del Rashbá Sec. 170). Lo anterior es porque está prohibido utilizar las velas de Janucá [no se puede obtener ningún beneficio de ellas, pueden ser utilizadas sólo para la mitzvá de verlas y recordar el milagro] sin importar si es Shabbat o un día de semana, ni si quiera para revisar monedas o contarlas bajo su luz [esto demuestra que incluso para tareas que no requieren una luz muy potente, está prohibido utilizar las velas de Janucá]. Es más, incluso no se pueden usar las velas para asuntos sagrados [como el estudiar Torá]. Sin embargo, hay quienes permiten hacer asuntos sagrados [a la luz de las velas de Janucá] para lo cual acostumbran a agregar una vela más, para que así, si llega a beneficiarse de la luz, lo haga de la vela agregada que fue encendida al final y apenas un tanto apartada de las demás velas de la Mitzvá. REMÁ: Y en nuestras tierras no se acostumbra agregar [una vela más] sino que deja junto a ellas [las velas de Janucá que son Mitzvá] el Shamash [la vela servidora] con la que se encienden las demás velas. [Esta costumbre] es mejor, por tanto se debe hacer [la vela servidora, el Shamash] más largo que las demás velas. Debido a que si va a utilizar la vela [la vela de Janucá para otros objetivos, beneficiándose de su luz], lo haga por medio de esta vela servidora (Mordejai). En el caso de que se hayan mezclado las velas de Janucá cuyo uso está prohibido, con otras velas, incluso 1 en 1000, no puede ser pasado por alto. [Lit. “Incluso en 1000 no se cancela” Podría pensarse que en este caso correspondería aplicar la ley del 1/60 en donde se permite el uso de un objeto prohibido o de un alimento prohibido si hay 60 veces más del elemento permitido, pero no es así en el caso de Janucá. Osea, si se mezcló una vela de Janucá, en mil velas que no son de Jánuca, aun así está prohibido beneficiarse de ellas]. Lo anterior porque es un Davar Shel Minián [es un objeto en específico sobre el cual se hizo la bendición, que se cuenta en forma particular] (Terumat HaDeshen Sec. 103), sino que lo que debe hacer es encender tantas velas [o las suficientes] dentro de la mixtura, de forma tal que se asegure que ha encendido una vela de las permitidas junto con una de las prohibidas, y de esa forma puede permitirse su uso (Opinión personal).",

Similarly, if after he kindled it he went to adjust it and unintentionally extinguished it, he is not bound to [rekindle] it. <i>Rem\"a: If he wants to be stringent on himself and go back and kindle it, he should not recite the benediction over it.

Sin embargo, encender la una de la otra por medio una tercera vela común y corriente, [que no sea de Janucá] está prohibido. Aun así, hay quienes consideran esto como permitido, a menos que exista la duda de que la tercera vela [que se utilizaría de mediadora entre las dos velas de Janucá] se llegara a apagar antes de que pudiera prender la otra vela de Janucá.

REMÁ: Por su parte, hay quienes acostumbran a ser más estrictos en cuanto a las velas de Janucá, llegando incluso a no encender de una a otra, puesto que la centralidad de la Mitzvá no es sino una sola vela, y [con respecto a las demás velas] no son para la Mitzvá [No es tan claro que su encendido sea tan mandatorio como una vela unitaria, la primera].
