            "(1) IN ORDER TO SERVE HIS CREATOR - because for this was man created. As the text says \"Every one that is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory... \" And even if his Evil Inclination advises him in the winter and says 'How will you arise in the morning, because it is very cold?' or in the summer advises and says 'How will you arise from your bed, when you still have not slept to your satisfaction?' Overcome him and do not listen to him, and think to yourself: If I had needed to arise to appear before a king of flesh and blood, how carefully and zealously would I arise and awaken in order to prepare myself for this service? All the more so and obviously, before the King of kings the Holy One blessed is He. ",
            "(2) THE DAWN - A secret in written in the Two Tablets of the Covenant, to connect the day and night with Torah and prayer, whether its morning or whether its evening. Immediately upon waking up from sleep if he doesn't plan to sleep more, he should wash his hands, even if he does so while still lying down. All the more so, he shouldn't walk four cubits without having washed his hands. He must be very careful in this regard. And the holy Zohar emphasizes the great punishment for this, for leaving the spirit of impurity on himself. In any case, he should not God forbid violate any other prohibition in order to not have a gap before washing his hands; like for instance, to stop himself from urinating for this purpose, or to take water which his friend had prepared for himself, if its not obvious to him that he will immediately be able to give him other [water] in exchange. And there are those who fail in this. And if he sees that the water is far and he doesn't have someone to bring it close to him, it is the custom of some of the observant ones (ba'alei ha'nefesh) to walk little by little in increments shorter than four cubits. The Sha'arei Teshuvah write about this that its better if hes able to run and not allow the spirit of evil to linger on his hands. There are those who say in regards to this idea that the entire house is like his four cubits, but we shouldn't rely on this unless in a time of pressure. If when he arises at night he sees that he does not have enough water to wash his hands three times as it appropriate to rid the spirit of impurity, nevertheless he should not God forbid forgo his Torah study because of this until daylight, but rather he should wash his hands a little or clean his hands on whatever he has to wash, make a blessing, and learn, as per the law of the Talmud and the Poskim[commonly referring to Rabbinic discussions post-Talmud, particularly contemporary halachic discussions]. ",
            "(3) WHEN THE GROUP IS PRAYING - Even [if] (though) the time for prayer has not passed, in any case he is commanded to pray with a group. This is elaborated below at the end of Seif Katan 9.",
            "THE RIGHTEOUS - He should envision in his soul/mind always how to stand before Hashem blessed be his name, because The Holy One's glory fills all the land. And it is written in the name of the Arizal, that he should always paint the name YHV'H next to his eyes in the essence of Fear of Heaven, for this is Y-H-V-H (with the vowelization of the word Fear [YIR'AH]), for this is the secret of \"I shall set the Lord before me always\" and this greatly benefits one's Fear of Heaven. There are those who were accustomed because of this, to have parchments of a Menorah drawn inside their Siddurim, on which it is written \"I shall set the Lord...\" Etc..., with the Four Letters and other Names, and this Menorah is called \"I have set\" [\"Shiviti\"]. And the purpose [of this] is so that it should be remembered not to speak in idle chatter during prayer -out of Fear of God. And it is written in the Gates of Repentance [Sha'arei Teshuvah] in the name of the Tevuas Shor, \"It is proper to set out with force to abolish this custom[of writing this parchment of Divine Names] because in general they[people] don't protect this parchment properly, \"and it falls in most of the streets\"(it becomes disgusting and embarrassing), and as well many times it[the parchment]comes to erasure of The [Divine] Name. As well, it appears that: the big Menorahs which are depicted on the parchments which are affixed in the Shul in front of the podium[of the Chazzan/Prayer Leader] under a surface of glass- this is not subject to the reasoning which was mentioned previously\" - end quote. However, the [parchments] which are affixed in[front of] the podium without a surface, there is[grounds] to protests against them, because through the candles which are [customarily] affixed on the podium[hence being under the parchment melting the ink with the heat of the candle] , after many times[of lighting these candles] , it will lead to erasure of The [Divine] Name, Heaven Forbid.",
            "(5)  BEFORE MEN - Never the less, he should never fight with them, because the quality of brazenness is very despicable, and its not appropriate to use it at all, even in the service of the Lord blessed be his name, because he the will acquire the attribute in his personality even in matters which are not in the service of Hashem. ",
            "THAT ARE MOCKING YOU - If he's an average person who in the company of great men, he shouldn't be embarrassed to learn or to do the mitzvah. If its possible for him to perform it not directly in their presence, its even better. However, if you're in the presence of other average folk who would learn from him, then on could say, that it would be better to do it in their presence, so that they should learn from him how do as he has done. However, he should direct his heart [intention] to the Name of the Heaven, but not boastfully God forbid. ",
            "AND WHEN HE IS ALONE - It means to say, even when he is in the privacy of his home, also he should be walking with the Lord his God, as [the Re'ma] concludes...",
            "WITH ALACRITY - Not exactly, but rather he should wait a bit and not get up immediately, because it is damaging for the body. It is good to say immediately upon rising \"I am gratefully to you my eternal king who has returned my soul in kindness; great is your faith.\" It should be said with a pause after \"kindness\", and \"great of your faith\" without pause. And this is from as its written \"renewal of mornings\" etc..., that the Holy One Blessed be He upholds his faithfulness to returns the souls to its depositor in the morning. And there is no need to wash hands, even if they are filthy, because in this wording there is no remembrance of the name of ADNOOT or any other name. And anyhow, it is forbidden to learn Torah before washing hands, and also forbidden before the blessing of the Torah.",
            "IT IS FITTING FOR EVERYONE - The Mekubalim at length explained the necessity  of getting up at midnight because it is very great. The siddurim have written how this is to be done according to the Arizal. Midnight is always at the middle of the night, even if the nights are long or short. This is 12 hours after midday. The time to cry for the Churban should be just before midnight and from midnight onwards they should study Torah, and at the end of the night you should ask for what you need. Some say also Shomrim Laboker. If it is near to sunrise, you should say the Tehillim and skip the Kinnos. Then you should say Shomrim Laboker. After the Tikun,  you should learn Mishnayos before anything. If you are Zocheh to the wisdom of truth, this is a very favourable time. The Acharonim have accepted from Shichvi to Kumi. This is from the weeks that they say Shichvi until Tisha B'av where they say Kumi, these weeks you do not need to get up in the night. Some people say from Tu B'av until the 15th of Iyar you should get up in the night. The people who hold by the Kabboloh hold that you should stand up all the time. "

            "But Now etc: Because we do not have the presumption of being God fearing such that angels would be escorting us and that we would ask of them to wait for us until we exit.",
            "Until Sitting: And in the same way, he shouldn't get up while he is revealed.",
            "And Should Not Go (Together): And if he's afraid, one can put his hand on his head through the window, but only if he won't see his uncovering (Mishnah Brura: Siman 3, Seif 8), and it's even forbidden to enter with his wife, but with a small child who doesn't know, it's allowed to enter the bathroom.",
            "And Should Not Speak: And if it's for a great need, it's allowed, as long as he isn't excusing himself. But while he is still excusing himself, even for a great need, it's forbidden. And if there's another person, close the door, and another man wants to enclose himself at the same time as him, they shouldn't speak. Only women talk when they go to a specific bathroom that is in public, like a bathroom that was in the field, back in the day, or in the courtyard of the synagogue. In these countries, the Sages said that they should talk to each other in order for their voices to be heard from outside, so a man won't enclose himself there and be alone with them (Sanhedrin 19), and therefore from there, they (women) go in twos to the bathroom.",
            "To touch: If one is not able to excrete, he should walk four amot and sit, then stand, then sit until he excretes, or he can distract his mind with other matters. And one should not excrete while standing.",
            "A tefach: And not anymore because of modesty, but there should be two tefachim in front of him in case he ends up urinating while he is pushing himself to defecate, and one needs two tefachim because of the flow of urine which sprays far. The Ba''ch wrote that it is proper to be stringent ― that there should also only be one tefach in front of himself ― but many Acharonim do not agree with him. One should be careful there that he does not soil his clothes, his body, or his shoes.",
            "Open: However, in a courtyard any manner is permitted wrote the Beit Yosef and the Magen Avraham. However, the Taz agrees with our teacher Rabbi Yitzchak Abuhav, that in a courtyard, east-west is also forbidden in the center of the courtyard, for is he not exposed in that spot unless he gets close to one side by the walls. So also wrote the Drisha and other later authorities.",
            "In which there are no partitions: However, if there are partitions there, and even only one partition to the west side, one should sit on the side of the partition, leaning against it (that is, in any case, within four amot), with his back to the west toward the partition, and he should excrete there. So also, if the wall is on the east side, one should sit leaning against it with his back to the east. There are those who are strict regarding this because his frontal nakedness will face west and the Shechinah is in the west. In a place where it is possible, it is good to be strict. The Pri Megadim wrote that there is no minimum height for the partition, only that one's nakedness should not be exposed — by this measure it is permitted.",
            "Or vice versa: There are those who say to not do the reverse. It is good to be careful with this.",
            "However, east, etc...: Because the Shechinah dwells in the west, and even if he turns his face to the west it is forbidden. The east is opposite the west so it also has holiness.",
            "However, east, etc...: Only intend that the head of the bed is facing north and its foot is to the south. In the responsa of Menachem Azariah he ruled according to what The Zohar wrote in Parshah Bamidbar that the head and foot of the bed should be facing to the east and west, but he concluded there that the head should be to the west, and so it is written in the Artzot Hachaim in the name of some Acharonim. However, in every place it is better to accustom oneself at the outset according to the Shulchan Aruch, because in the responsa of Binyan Shel Simcha he wrote in the name of the Gr''a who also said that the intention of The Zohar is in accordance with the Gemara and not according to the interpretation of Rabbi Menachem Azariah above.",
            "Even when one's wife is not...: It is explained in the Artzot Hachaim that regarding this one need not be stringent except when lying down naked without screens around the bed.",
            "[Amendation of the text of the Shulchan Aruch to include \"do not\"]",
            "If one's back is facing the holy (the temple mount), then it is permitted to urinate. The GR\"A agrees that, even when the holy is not visible, it is forbidden to urinate while facing that direction. It is forbidden to urinate facing a synagogue or study hall, as to not be included in the category \"their backs to the sanctuary of the LORD.\" Similarly, one should not build a synagogue or study hall facing a bathroom so that the anus is not revealed in that direction. And the Artzos Hachaim writes if one builds a wall in the middle to divide between the walls of the bathroom and the synagogue, there is presumably no reason to be stringent.",
            "As his friend cannot see his nakedness (because he is behind the wall). Similarly in a courtyard, one should relieve himself behind one of the walls of the house. Even though his friend can hear him using the restroom, there is no requirement of modesty in this matter, only shame and embarrassment in front of people. And someone who doesn't care, doesn't care (meaning it is permissible).",
            "His nakedness, meaning what he reveals of himself in the front and the back. Even though his body is visible and his defecation audible, it is permitted.",
            "Because one ties tefillin with his right hand on his left arm. There are additional reasons given in the Gemara, and it is proper to be careful as well not to wipe with the third finger on the left hand because the strap of the tefillin is wrapped around it. The Achronim write that a left-handed person who does everything with their left hand should wipe with his  \"left\", meaning his right, hand. If he writes with his left hand but does everything else with his right or the opposite consult the Biur Halacha.",
            "Even if it is smooth and doesn't tear the skin, and if it isn't smooth and has sharp pieces there is also danger that it may tear the anal sphincter.",
            "However if he himself already wiped with it, or it has dried out, or he wipes with a different part, then it is permitted.",
            "And witchcraft is uncommon, therefore it is permitted with earthenware that is smooth.",
            "It's possible that the Ramah was referring to only the items he listed and not dry grass, and it's proper to be stringent as the grass may cut the skin (siman 312 sif 5 see the Pri Megadim). Rabbi Akiva Eiger writes in the same of the Sefer Chasidim that when one leaves the bathroom he should check the place where he sat to make sure it is not dirty because perhaps his friend will come suddenly or in the night and sit there.",
            "That is to say, that one should not expose himself at night more than he does during the day, and one should not expose himself (when in the bathroom) until he is sitting, and other matters similar to these. Because before Hashem, Blessed is He, darkness is like light. If there is nobody there, one can defecate in the streets, as long as he is careful that he is not defecating where people walk, lest they become filthy. However, if there are people on the street, it is prohibited to defecate there. All of this is regarding defecating, but to urinate is permitted, even during the day in front of many people, if he has no other place to go. This is even permitted in front of a woman, since there is danger if he does not go. A woman may not even urinate in front of a baby, since there exists an element of audacity in this. However, when she urinates off to the side where she is not really in anybody's presence, there is no prohibition.",

            "Translation of the words - like the Rabbis say (Berakhot 47) that one should not \"throw\" a blessing from his mouth, rather he should concentrate when saying it and make the blessing calmly. And this is the language used in the Sefer HaChinuch siman (chapter) 46: When one washes his hands, makes a blessing on a fruit, or mitzvot that are comfortable in his mouth [which he regularly says], every individual should concentrate their heart toward their Creator, Who does wonderous kindness to him, and gave him fruits or bread to benefit from, and commanded him to do mitzvot. And he should not act like individuals who do things out of habit and let words leave their mouths without any consideration; for this causes G-d to become angry at his people. And he sent to us in the hand of Isaiah and said (Isaiah 29:13) \"Because this people have approached me; with their mouth and with their lips they honor Me, but their heart they draw far away from Me.\" And see further there how terrible the punishment for this is."

This is only l'chatchila (preferably), after the fact [if it was not done standing] he has fulfilled his obligation according to all. Most of the Archronim agreed that preferably he should make the blessing before the wrapping, at the time that he's holding it in his hand and intends on wrapping it, that this is \"just as he's about to do it.\" He shouldn't make the bracha while this talis is still folded.",
            "Even though we make the blessing \"to wrap,\" covering the body alone is wrapping, and this is essentially the act of wrapping.

See the Taz, who opines that it's proper to not remove one's kippah from one's head during prayer, even thought one's head is also covered with the tallis. The Bach writes that one must have one's tallis on one's head from the beginning until the end.  At the least, one should stand wrapped at least the time that it takes to walk four cubits.  It's written in the Kavanos of the Arizal: One should cover the Tefillin Shel Rosh with one's Tallis.  See the end of Siman 27, that it should not be completely covered.  "

            " A graveyard – Even within four cubits of the start of the graves is also prohibited if there is no mechitza (halachik partition) in between. And the reason why the author of the Shulchan Aruch didn’t join these phrases together and say ‘It is prohibitted to go within 4 cubits of a grave or of a corpse’ is, according to the Magen Avraham, to indicate that from the start of the graveyard it is forbidden even if this is more than four cubits away from a grave. There are those who are lenient about this. And see in the Biur Halacha, [where the Mishna Brura says] that in the middle of a graveyard, where there are graves all around, it seems that one should be stringent even four cubits away from a grave, but at the edge of the graveyard, where there are no graves but the area is designated for them, one need not be stringent above the law requiring four cubits distance. Even so, it is correct not to enter the boundaries of a graveyard at all with Tefillin on one’s head, lest one come within 4 cubits of a grave unawares.",

It seems from the Taz in Siman 84, that a Mikvah has the rules of the middle room for all purposes and only the Bracha for the immersion is allowed to be said there, look there for his reason. [A Mikvah is a ritual bath – used by men daily, weekly, or even annually according to custom, and used by women one week after the conclusion of a monthly cycle. Women make a blessing after immersing themselves.] But from the Magen Avraham in this Siman, it seems that if there is no one presently naked in it, one may put on Tefillin and say the B’racha, because they were only stringent in a bath house because of the intense sweat as a result of the hot water – which is not the case in a mikvah. [And if they use hot water in the Mikvah as well, further examination is needed.] But if there is someone there naked, it is forbidden to enter with Tefillin or Holy Scriptures because it is forbidden to stand in front of G-d’s Name naked. Look later in Siman 84 in the MB about this.",

And most of the decisors hold that one can fulfill their obligation in this way. And it is better than just saying it in your head. For saying it in your head is not the same as actually saying it. But this is not the case with hearing which is actually like saying.

See ch. 193 sect. 1 and in Sha'arei Knesset HaGedolah he brings in the name of the Birkat Avraham that this is specifically an individual who fulfills the obligation of an individual. But the individual who fulfills the obligation of the masses or an individual who who fulfills the obligation of another two in the blessing after meals, even if they don't understand Hebrew, their obligation is fulfilled."

            "The essence of the mitzvah of delight in Shabbat is explained to us by the prophets, as it says: “and you shall call the Sabbath a delight,” and there are authorities who believe that the essence is from the Torah, for Shabbat is part of the times that are called holyas it says “and on the seventh day there shall be a Shabbos of complete rest, a holy occasion” (Leviticus 23:3), and the words \"a holy occasion\" are explained in the Sifra that it is to sanctify it and honor with clean clothing and enjoy it with the pleasure of eating and drinking. And our rabbis spoke highly of the importance of this mitzvah (in Shabbat 118), and they said that anyone who delights in the Shabbat, is given an inheritance with no bounds, is saved from oppression of the nations, and merits wealth through this. See there for several more statements in this regard. And behold, regarding the parameters of this commandment, there are three applicable statements of our Sages of Blessed Memory: 1) That which they said that a person must delight in it through large fish, heads of garlic, and cooked beets, for those were esteemed dishes in their days. And similarly in every location, one should delight in Shabbat according to the custom, with food and drink that is considered delight for them. And since in general, most people get their delight from meat and wine and sweets, therefore it is brought in Chapter 250, Section 2 that one should have a lot of meat and wine and sweets according to one’s abilities. 2) That which the Sages said that a person fulfills the commandment of delighting in the Shabbat even through a small thing that he does for the honor of Shabbat, and even kasa d'hars'na (which are small fish fried in their own oils [a relatively inexpensive way of enhancing the Shabbat meal beyond the absolute basics]). 3) That which Rabbi Akiva said, \"Make your Shabbat like a weekday rather than be dependent on the charity of others.\" And the differences between these statements can be understood in the following manner: Someone who has the means is required to honor the Shabbat according to his ability, while someone in dire straits - namely, that he only has enough food for two meals for this Shabbat - in regard to him Rabbi Akiva said, \"Make your Shabbat like a weekday rather than be dependent on the charity of others.\" This person would not be obligated to have the Third Meal nor the kasa d'hars'na (fried fish). But if someone does have enough money to buy food for three meals and a bit more, he is obligated to spend that money for Shabbat in order to fulfill the three meals and the fried fish. Likewise, for someone who has nothing at all and is entirely dependent on charity, the charity directors are required to give him at least enough for three meals and fried fish. (And for a distinguished individual who has become impoverished, he must be provided for in accordance with the dignity to which he is accustomed, as is clarified in Yoreh Deah, Chapter 253). And we don't say in this regard, \"Make your Shabbat like a weekday rather than be dependent on charity,\" for we only say this about someone who still does not need to take charity. However,  for someone who has already arrived at this condition where he he must reach out his hand and take charity, we give him everything as mentioned. (And in places where the charity directors  are accustomed to disburse to the poor only two meals and not the Third Meal, they are not behaving properly, and at the very least they must beware of this during the summer time [when the days are long]). And for this the Shulchan Aruch comes to say that if he has some small means for himself, he must exert himself to honor and delight in the Shabbat properly since it is possible for him and he has the means to spend on this. And it is not sufficient merely to spend enough money for fried fish [if he can manage to spend more]. And to this end the Shulchan Aruch concludes that a person should be frugal during the rest of the week so that he will have the remaining means to honor the Shabbat. And see the Ta\"Z, Tosafot Shabbat, and other late halachic decisors who wrote that even someone who is in dire straits who is legally exempt from having to partake of the Third Meal and fried fish should nevertheless strive to at least be in the middle category, namely through fulfilling the three meals and fried fish."

Be very careful that the mitzvah of bathing (for Shabbos) shouldn't lead to a concern of violating Shabbos. And with our many sins, many fail in this in the winter days when the days are short that they wait until right before dark. And even if you complete your washing permissibly, also be careful of a prohibition because at times you will comb your hair afterwards, which is a Torah violation of Shabbos. It is also common that after finishing all the activities (of bathing) one squeezes out the towel from the water that it was holding which would be included in the prohibition of M'chabeis (laundering). It is proper for all who fear god with their hearts, to warn the nation not to do this and then you will have the merit of the community. And their is a principle that if the nation does a sin you could've stopped, you also receive punishment. However, if you stop the nation from doing this, you are also rewarded. If you don't stop the people in your house, you get the sin of the people in your house. If you don't stop the people in your city, you get the sin of your city.",

When it's used to stand something over a flame, like a pot or a dish in the oven, during the year, and then one wishes to use it on Pesach, one needs to heat it in a flame, since sometimes dough is spilt on it. The tripod then absorbs leaven taste, by means of the flame. And this is only \"from the outset\", and out of the strictness of leaven -- since in truth, two pots that touch one another don't have any taste transfer, as was explained in Yoreh Deah 92:7. And there's other support for this viewpoint, as even if one spills on it, this is burnt up and leaves, because it's always in the flame. And therefore, certainly \"light heating\" suffices, and after the fact if it was used without heating at all(!), even this we do not forbid."

            "(1)- <b>We are accustomed</b>- the implication is that it is only a custom. And the custom relies that since there is a scriptural proximity of eating Matza to the Korban Pesach. As it says \"And he shall sacrifice the Pesach to Hashem, your G-d\" (Deuteronomy 16:2) etc. and <small>(immediately after it says)</small> \"Seven Days you shall eat on it Matzos\" (Deuteronomy 16:3) etc. Thus we say like with the slaughter of the Pesach it should be after the 6th hour <small>(on the eve of Pesach)</small>, so the making of Matzos of the mitzvah should be after the 6th hour. But in a strictly legal sense the Poskim establish that there is not to worry about this because the main scripitural proximity <small>(i.e. a <i>hekeish</i> where closely placed laws in the Torah are derived to have similar related rules)</small> is said regarding eating Matzvah, on the 1st night that one should be careful to eat before Chatzos <small>(halachic midnight)</small> like with the Korban Pesach like is elucidated later in Siman 477, but not regarding the making of Matzvah. Therefore, after the fact if one bakes matzvah before the 6th hour even a month or two before Pesach, and does it for the sake of the Mitzvah of Matza, it is fitting <small>(to fulfill the mitzvah on the 1st nights by the Seder).</small>",
            "(2) <b>Mitzvah Matzah</b> - that it is necessary to him to fulfill his obligation on the two first nights but other matzos we are not accustomed to be careful in this <small>(stringency of preparing on the Eve of Pesach)</small>.",
            "(3) <b>Until after etc.</b> - Look later in Siman 460 Paragraph 3 that it is necessary to be careful when kneading during the time of the prohibition of Chametz. Behold most Jews are not accustomed to be careful even in Mitzvah Matza to knead on the eve of Pesach except for a few of them. I searched in the Later Authorities and found in the Bigdei Yishah <small>(commentary on Shulchan Aruch)</small> a reason to protest the custom because there are many opinions that even on the eve of Pesach a little bit <small>(i.e. the prohibition of Chametz which begins on the eve is regarding even a very minimal amount of Chametz causes a large amount to become Chametz)</small> like was eludicdated earlier in Siman 452. And this is hard to be careful that he does not find even a little Chametz in the wheat that they start not to sprout. Therefore we bake before in order to nullify <small>(the potential)</small> Chametz. And in the Maamar Mordechai I found that he writes, and this his language, \"Nowadays many are lenient in this matter because it is tough besides for a few that are careful in this to knead and bake after the 6th hour the Matzos that one fulfills in them on the two nights. And so is fitting to do.\" ",
            "(4) <b>6th hour</b> - behold the Chok Yaakov sides with the Bach that after six and half hours specifically; however, in the Magen Avrohom and in the Elya Rabbah, they side like the Shulchan Aruch that after six hours. So is the <i>p'sak</i> in the Bais Meir, and similarly is implied in the Biur HaGra. And one should know that from a legal perspective <small>(i.e. as opposed to stringency considerations)</small> it is permitted to bake Matza on Pesach; rather, those particular <small>(in mitzva observance)</small> are accustomed to bake everything prior to Pesach, that if a small bit of Chametz gets mixed, it can be nullified as opposed to on Pesach that the prohibition includes a small bit. And obviously when baking before Pesach even if there was in it a small bit of Chametz in the flour, it was already mixed and nullified, and permitted afterwards to bake the Matzos on Pesach; since, there is not becoming Chametz after baking. And there are those men of action that are strict on themselves, and they do not soak nor cook Matzos on Pesach from a concern that  perhaps a little flour remains in the Matzos within that did not knead well, and by soaking it will become Chometz. See the Sharei Teshuva Siman 460 that from a legal perspective, there is not to worry for this; since, an establishment of a prohibition we do not establish <small>(i.e. we do not assume a prohibition without cause)</small> and especially nowadays that the custom is to make them very thin <small>(i.e. the Matzos)</small>. Nonetheless, one who is accustomed to this stringency, do not abandon it, see there that he details in the matter. Write the Poskim one who bakes on the night of Yom Tov Mitvah Matzos should not bake except for what is necessary that night, not for the 2nd night. However, if he baked <small>(some matzos)</small> while still day, on the 1st night, he can say I'll eat today <small>(i.e. the 1st night)</small> hot bread <small>(i.e. freshly baked Matzos)</small>. Then he will be able to bake other Matzos on the 1st night <small>(to eat on the 1st night itself)</small>, and those that he baked while still day he will store away for the 2nd night. Write the Later Authorities that initially it is not worthwhile to bake on Yom Tov in order not to come to complications in separating Challah on Yom Tov. Similarly <small>(there are issues)</small> in pounding the flour, washing the utensils, that the children shouldn't fall asleep, and that one not come to eat the <i>Afikomen</i> after <i>Chatzos</i>. ",
            "(5) <b>Knead Erev Shabbos</b> - that is to say that not like the Stict to bake on the Night of Yom Tov as was explained at the end of Subparagraph 4.",
            "(6) <b>After the 6th hour</b> - as a remembrance to other years."

The Ari ZL brings down that One should know that anyone who doesn't sleep at all, and is engrossed in learning Torah, can be assured that his sleep will be made up and nothing wrong will occur to him. The reason (for this minhug) the Magen Avraham writes that because Israel Slept all night (the night of kabbalas haTorah) and Hashem need to awaken thenm in order to receive the torah(Brought through a Midrash) Therefore, we need to now stay up all night on shavous as a Tikkun. One who is up all night needs to be careful that he does not make a netillas yadyim in the morning unless he first used the bathroom before davoning and then he may make an Al netillas yadyim and an Asher Yatzar like we explained above.. And for the beracha on the tallis katan there are differing opinions among the Authorities and because of this one should try to excuse himself by making a blessing on the Tallis Gadol like we said....

On all of these days, all Israel fasts because of the misfortunes that befell them on these days, in order to arouse their hearts to open up to the paths of repentance [teshuvah].  This [fasting] will be a recollection of our evil deeds and the deeds of our ancestors which were like our deeds now, such that they caused them--and us--these misfortunes, and in the recollection of these things we will return [nashuv] to become better [people], as it is written (Lev. 26:40), \"And they will confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their ancestors...\"  Therefore, each person is obliged to take to heart on these days to examine their deeds and to repent [lashuv] of them, because the fast [itself] is not the essential [thing], as it is written [in Jonah 3:10] about the people of Nineveh: \"And the Eternal saw their deeds, that they repented [turned back] from their evil path...\" The Sages, may their memories be a blessing, said that their sackcloth and their fasting were not mentioned--just their deeds.  Fasting is nothing but a preparation for repentance.  Therefore, those people who, as they are fasting, go on walks or [pursue] trivial matters grasp the issue of secondary importance, but loses track of the essence.  But in any case, one may not exempt oneself by means of repentance alone, because to fast on these days is a positive commandment from the prophets, as we wrote above.",

On it, the tablets were broken as Moses descended from the mountain, as is explained in the Torah [Ex. 32:19]; the daily offering was cancelled and was no longer sacrificed in the First Temple; [the walls of] the city [of Jerusalem] were breached [in advance] of the destruction of the Second Temple; the evil Apostomos burnt the Torah; and an idol was placed in the Holy Temple.  On on 9 Av, the great destruction occurred. The First Temple was destroyed on [that day], as was the Second; and on that very day it was decreed that our ancestors that were in the desert would not enter the land; and on that very day, [Romans] conquered a great town, called Beytar [during the Bar Kokhba revolt], which was home to thousands of Jews, all of whom fell into the hands of the idolaters and all of whom perished, which was a calamity as great as the destruction of the Temple; and on this very day, destined for calamity, the evil Turnusrufus plowed the Temple and its environs, thus fulfilling what was said: \"Zion will be plowed as a field\" (Jer. 26:18). And on the day of 3 Tishrei, Gedalia son of Ahikam was murdered.  He had been appointed to lead the remaining survivors after the [first] destruction [and his death led to] the extinguishing of the remaining embers of Israel, because [in the wake of it] all were exiled and thousands were killed.

Likewise, a person should not be strict about wearing shoes in order not to be a laughingstock. Likewise, if the 10th of Tevet falls on Friday, a person should not be strict about not washing in hot water out of respect for Shabbat.",
            "And it is not required ... while it is still day... [That is,] as is required on Tish'ah Be'Av. Rather, it is permitted to eat and drink during the evening [of these fasts]."
