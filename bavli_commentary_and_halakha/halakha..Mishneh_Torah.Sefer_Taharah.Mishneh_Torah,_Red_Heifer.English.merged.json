            "1. Extra stringencies were instituted with regard to the purification process involving the ashes of the red heifer. A person who was pure - even if he immersed himself in a mikveh for the sake of sacrificial service and stood and served on the altar - is not pure with regard to the purification process involving the ashes of the red heifer, nor with regard to the burning of the red heifer, drawing its water, sanctifying it, or sprinkling it unless he immerses himself for the sake of the purification process involving the ashes of the red heifer. Afterwards, he is considered pure for that purpose. Similarly, keilim - even a receptacle taken from the Temple Courtyard - are not considered as pure with regard to the purification process involving the ashes of the red heifer unless they were immersed for that purpose. Similarly, all foods and liquids - even if they are pure - are considered as impure in this context.",

            "12. Everyone's word is accepted with regard to the ritual purity of articles and persons involved in this purification process, even that of the common people. The rationale is that because of all the stringencies and extra measures applied to it, everyone is careful with regard to it. This is alluded to in the Torah which states Numbers 19:9: \"And it will be for the congregation of Israel for safekeeping.\" Implied is that all of Israel are fit for its safekeeping. Therefore if a common person brings an earthenware container from his home and says: \"This container is pure for the purification process involving the ashes of the red heifer,\" it is considered as pure. Water may be sanctified in it and sprinkled from it even though this container would be considered as impure for sacrificial foods and for terumah. Similarly, if a common person says: \"I have purified myself for the purification process involving the ashes of the red heifer\" or the water for this process was in his possession and he says that it is pure, his word is accepted. For no Jewish person treats this purification process lightly.\n"
