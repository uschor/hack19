                "\"Rav Pada would tell you 'the end of of [the Mishna] states that R' Eliezer says he only negate 7 [days of his Nazirite count]\" - Corresponding to the days that [a Naziritie would normally ] count, [and get sprinkled] on the third and seventh [day] because of impurity:",
                "\"And if you reason that [a Nazirite vow] needs to be 30 days, all [the days of his vow] should be negated.\" - Rather, this can't be, because the main Nazirite vow, according to R' Eliezer, is only 29 days. And why did R' Eliezer say that 7 days should be negated? It is because he needs to shave after he has been sprinkled [with purifying waters] on the 3rd and 7th days, as scripture says 'On the 7 day he should be shaved.' In principle, no days should need to be negated, since he [the Nazirite] has already counted 29 days in purity. But now, since he has been shaved while he is impure, a Rabbinic enactment goes into effect - "
