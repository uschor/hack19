                    "In the Mordechai at the beginning of the chapter Kol HaBasar (Talmud Chullin):  \"A responsum of Maharam (of Rothenburg):  Once, from one meal to the next I found cheese between (my) teeth.  I made a personal decree to be strict (regarding eating) meat following cheese (just as one must wait before eating) cheese following meat; with fowl, I am lenient (to eat fowl directly after cheese),\" end quote. / Here is the discussion of Issur veHeiter Ha'Aroch chapter 40: \"If one ate soft cheese younger than (Hebrew should read: קודם) six months or other kinds of milk (products), he may eat meat immediately at the same meal by means of cleaning out (Hebrew should read: קינוח) and washing his hands and mouth.  However, if one eats twelve-month old cheese or moldy (מתולעת, 'wormy') cheese, even though no prohibition pertains, nevertheless it is a measure of piety not to eat meat afterwards at the same meal, in accordance with the responsum (Hebrew should read: כתשובת) of Maharam,\" end quote. / And so, many have the practice not to eat meat after (eating) hard cheese that sticks between the teeth, just as we do not eat cheese after meat. / And Beit Yosef wrote in Orach Chaim, chapter 173, \"Yet there are those who practice a personal stringency not to eat meat after cheese at the same meal\" and thus one finds in the Zohar that one should be strict in this matter.  Therefore one should be strict even with fowl following cheese.  If the Maharam had seen the Zohar, he would not have been lenient with fowl.  That is the end of his words there.  He quoted the Zohar on this issue.  "
