                    "\"All meat and milk [mixtures] ... are permitted to benefit from.\" See the Tur and Issur v'Heter. It is also the opinion of the Mechaber (Rav Yosef Caro) in seif 3 that eating chicken in milk is a rabbinic prohibition and is permitted for receiving benefit even rabbinically. This is also the opinion of HaRav Aharon HaLevi in the Sefer HaChinuch Mitzvah 113. It is also the opinion of the Rambam in chapter 9 of Hilchot of Forbidden Foods explained there, he also explains in his commentary of the Mishnah in Chapter All the Meat (Hullin). It is also explained by HaRav HaMaggid (Vidal of Tolosa in the Maggid Mishneh commentary on Mishneh Torah). It is also understood by Maharshal in Chapter These Forbidden Things (אלו טריפות) siman 100. And the remaining Acharonim hold like the Rambam, and not like the Bach who held that the Rambam actually thought that chicken in milk is prohibited for receiving benefit rabbinically just like eating. And HaMordechai held this in chapter אין מעמידין and noted in the final chapter of Avoda Zara that through pickling or salting it is permitted to receive benefit. and this is how the Mechaber below holds."

                [
                    "\"But meat of a pure animal in milk that is impure etc.\" The Tur says, 'but pure meat (of a kosher animal) in impure milk (milk from a non-kosher animal) or impure meat in pure milk, and meat of a chicken and non-domesticated kosher animal in pure milk is only a rabbinic prohibition for eating and are permitted to cook and receive benefit.' And the Beit Yosef writes, '[the Tur] did not intend to write this language since we don't see this language, that it is only rabbinic, for the first two cases, but only for the non-domesticated animal and chicken in pure milk. This is because in the case of pure meat in impure milk or the opposite, the Rabbis did not prohibit to eat because of mixing meat and milk. They did not establish any Rabbinic prohibitions [in this case], since it is already a Torah prohibition to consume impure meat or impure milk.' This is the corrected way to understand the text [of the Tur] and it is the proper understanding. However, the Bach understands the Tur as is written, that the first two cases are rabbinic prohibitions of mixing meat and milk. The practical reason being 'the piece becomes carrion'/ChaNaN (חנ\"נ\\ חתיכה נעשית נבילה explained in siman 92) which only applies in the case of mixing meat and milk and also to the case of 'the piece that is proper for serving' look there. This is the opinion of the Perisha. According to this, which is how we hold, ChaNaN applies to all forbidden foods, as the [Rema] writes in siman 92 seif 4 see there and search. This is also clear from Rashi and the Ran (Chapter All the Meat - Chullin 113a in the mishna) that [ChaNaN] is not a prohibition based on mixing meat and milk at all even rabbinically, and there is no reason at all that the Rabbis would prohibit on the basis of mixing meat and milk. It makes sense that the Rabbis prohibited mixing chicken with milk, lest one think they can also eat other meat milk, as the Rambam states there. However, the notion to prohibit pure meat with impure milk or vice versa has no reason to worry  about transgressing another prohibited act. This seems to be the intention of the Beit Yosef in not prohibiting [pure meat and impure milk or vice versa] on the basis of mixing meat and milk, unlike the Bach, since it is already forbidden by the Torah and there is no reason to make a decree [fence to protect against another act]. The Beit Yosef is saying that there is no practical case to prohibit on the basis of mixing meat and milk. And this is also the ruling for the case of 'the piece that is proper for serving' which explained later in seif 110. Also the Drisha writes at the end there that there is no place that pure meat and impure milk or vice versa has a rabbinic prohibition and is considered carrion on a rabbinic basis."

                    "\"Meat of a wild animal and of fowl...and even eating etc.\" It is the thought of the Mechaber (Rav Yosef Caro) that meat from a wild animal and chicken is not forbidden to eat [with milk], even cooked, [from the Torah,] but only Rabbinically. And is permitted for benefit or to cook. The Maharshal and Bach relied on the Maharai (HaRav Isserlin of Temurat Deshen) on his Commentary on Shaarei Dura (Siman 76) who states that it is difficult to be lenient because of the Tosafot (Chullin 104a). Therefore, they held that meat from a wild animal and chick with milk is a Torah prohibition. In my book, I brought sources proving it is Rabbinic from the Talmud, and I brought there many opinions supporting this. Even the Maharai actually held that is only difficult to be lenient based on Tosafot regarding eat cheese immediately after chicken, but he generally agreed that mixing chicken and milk is Rabbinic. As he wrote in his Commentary of Shaarei Dura (Siman 69) that fully developed eggs are permitted to eat with milk since mixing chicken and milk is only Rabbinic [thus allowing us to be] lenient....."

                    "\"But fish etc...\" The Ateret Zekenim (Menahem Mendel Auerbach 1620-89) writes, \"in all situations [we] do not eat fish with milk because of the danger [of tzara'at], as it is explained in Orech Chaim siman 173.\" Really it follows the Beit Yosef that says this, however it is a scribal error since it is actually written about fish and meat being prohibited because of the danger [of tzara'at] with no mention of milk. Everyday it is common practice to cook fish with milk and eat it. Also the Darchei Moshe rejects the Beit Yosef [the danger is only in cooking together, but eating one after another is fine see Darchei Moshe on the Tur Yoreh De'ah 116] as does Be'er Sheva daf 100 and other Achronim reject him in this, as does the Talmud in Chapter How do we roast (Pesachim 76b). We conclude that is apparent that [eating fish and milk is allowed and] it is not even a worry of danger [of tzara'at]."
