            "“A positive commandment” – So wrote the Rambam, who thinks that tefillah is a positive biblical commandment, as it is written, “and to serve God with all of your heart…”  But biblically, it is sufficient to recite one prayer a day, in any formulation that one wishes.  Therefore, most women have the practice of not praying regularly, because immediately after washing their hands in the morning they say some request, and this is biblically sufficient, and it is possible that the sages did not extend their obligation any further.  But the Ramban thinks that tefillah is rabbinic, and this is the opinion of most decisors."

Yose's opinion -- that the Torah was given on the 7th of Sivan -- is based on a need for husband and wife to separate a full three days. Since the Halakha today requires a 3 days for this particular separation, presumably R. Yose is correct about the date of Revelation.] (And I believe I've seen this question before in some Poseik's writings.)  But in our calendar, Shavuot is always on the 6th of Sivan!     In truth, the Rambam rules in the Laws of Avot haTumah Ch. 5, that we require only three half-days [of separation]. The Kesef Mishna comments there that in the Talmudic text of the Rambam and the Rashba, the Sages only require three half-days, and that the Rambam rules according to them. See there. If so, our custom is in line with the Rambam. What is written in Yoreh Deah, supporting R. Yose, is but stringency [chumra; it is the advised practice, but not the actual letter of the law].       A further difficulty: the Torah was given on the 51st day of their counting! For they left Egypt on the fifth of the week (Wednesday night / Thursday) and the Torah was given on a Shabbat. In this regard, the [book] HaAsarah Maamarot already answered, that it is meant to hint at the Second Day of Yom Tov of the Exiles. In fact, it’s possible that that’s the reason why Moshe added a day of his own accord, but this isn’t the place to discuss it.        ........ It says in the Zohar that the original pious ones would be awake all the night working in Torah.  And already most of those who learn do this.  It's possible to give a reason for this according to its simple understanding, that Israel slept all the night, and the Holy One Blessed be He had to wake them, as the midrash says.  Therefore, we need to fix this. ",

            "There are many reasons for eating dairy, I will copy the reason written in the Zohar: the previous seven weeks were in parrallel to the seven clean days a woman counts before immersing in the mikvah, we know that blood becomes milk, this is parallel to the movement from judgement to mercy, and the practice of our fathers is in our hands to fulfill. However, it is important to be careful not to violate any prohibitions (see Yoreh Deah 89)... "

            "Rambam rules (Beit HaBechira, chapter 6) that the holiness of the courtyard and of Jerusalem is eternal. See also Yevamot 82 in Tosafot and the Raavad disagree in various places. In the Mishnah (Mishnah maaser Sheni 1:5) it says that if there is no mikdash it [maaser] should be left to rot. If this is so, there is no holiness even for he that enters there, and there is no [penalty of] karet. [...] The words of the Rambam are correct that one who enters the place of the mikdash is liable for karet because we are all tamei met. "

            "<strong>A Man and His Wife.</strong> Such is apparent from the beginning of Arakhin [Arakhin 3b] where they say that priests are exempt from the Sukkah during the <i>Avodah</i>, see there. And this requires further study, for in Sukkah 28b: Since you might have thought, sit such as you dwell, since one dwells husband and wife, so too Sukkah must be husband and wife, so you have learned that women are exempt. And it should be said, that anyway the husband is not obligated in the Sukkah but where he can dwell there with his wife, and if not, he is <i>Mitzta'er</i> (discomforted) and is exempt from sleeping there, and such wrote the Shela\"h, see there. But anyway, this is still difficult, since if he made the Sukkah in a place where he cannot sleep, he has not fulfilled his obligation [when he sits in it], as is written in the Rem\"a in Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chayyim 640:14, and if so, if he does not have a Sukkah which is isolated [so that he can sleep there with his wife modestly] he has not fulfilled his obligation at all [even when he eats therein], and another difficulty is that in the Gemara we say that \"all of Israel are fit to sit in one Sukkah\", see there. And it must be said that since he can sleep there alone, the Sukkah is valid, for it is a residence, but he is anyway exempt, for he is considered discomforted."
