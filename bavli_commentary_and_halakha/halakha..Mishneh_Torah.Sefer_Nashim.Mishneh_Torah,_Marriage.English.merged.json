            "Before the giving of the Torah, it would be that if a man happened upon a woman in the marketplace and they wanted to marry each other, he would bring her into his house and consummate the marriage between them privately, and she would be his wife. Once the Torah was given, Israel was commanded that if a man wanted to marry a woman, he would acquire her first through witnesses, and afterwards she would be his wife, as it says, \"When a man takes a woman and comes (sleeps with) to her...\" (Deuteronomy 22:13).",
            "And taking a wife as such is a positive commandment of the Torah. And a woman is acquired through three means: money, a contract, or through intercourse. Marriage through intercourse and by contract is from the Torah, and by money is Rabbinical [lit. \"the words of the Scribes\"]. And this acquisition is what is called \"Kiddushin\" or \"Eirusin\" in several places. And a woman who is acquired through one of these three means is called a \"Mekudeshet\" or \"Meureset\"."

            "How is a woman sanctified (for engagement)? If one choses to do so with money (or its equivalent), it can not have less than the value of a \"Peruta\". He says to her, \"Behold, you are sanctified to me\", \"Behold, you are engaged to me\", \"Behold, with this, you are to be my wife\", and he gives her the object in front of witnesses. The man must be the one to say words that have the meaning of an acquisition, and it must be he that is giving her the money. ",
            "If she gives the money and says, \"I am sanctified to you\", \"I am engaged to you\", \"I am a wife to you\" or any other acquisition term, she is not sanctified. So too if she gives the money and he speaks, she is not sanctified. If he gives and she speaks, this is a questionable sanctification.",
            "If he sanctified with a document, he writes it on  paper or clay or of earth, or on anything he desires. \"Behold, you are sanctified to me\", \"Behold, you are engaged to me\" and so on (other terms), and gives her the document in front of witnesses. "

            "If a man betrothed a woman upon condition, her betrothal is valid if the condition has been fulfilled; if it has not been fulfilled, she is not betrothed. It is immaterial whether the condition proceeds from the man or the woman. Every condition in the world, whether in matters of betrothal or divorce, purchase or sale, or any other civil case, must consist of four things.",
            "The four things constituting any stipulation are as follows: 1) the stipulation must be double [stating both alternatives and their eventual consequences]; 2) the positive must be expressed before the negative; 3) the condition in the agreement must precede the act; 4) the condition must be possible of performance. If the condition lacks one of them, it is void as if there has been no condition attached. Then the betrothal or divorce of the woman takes effect immediately, the purchase or the gift is fulfilled forthright, as if there has been no condition expressed, just because the condition has lacked one of the four [components].",
            "If, for example, a man said to a woman: \"If you give me two hundred <i>zuz</i> you will be betrothed to me with this denar, and if you do not give me you will not be betrothed,\" and having imposed this condition he gave her the denar; it is a valid stipulation, and she is betrothed conditionally. If she gives him two hundred <i>zuz</i>, she will be betrothed in fact; if she fails to give him that amount, her betrothal is invalid.",
            "If, however, he said to her: \"You are betrothed to me with this denar,\" and he handed her the denar; then he completed the condition and said: \"If you give me two hundred <i>zuz</i> you will be betrothed, and if you do not give that amount you will not be betrothed,\" the condition is void, because he performed the act of handing her the denar before he stipulated the condition. Even though it all occurred instantly, while speaking, her betrothal took immediate effect and she does not have to give him anything.",
            "So too, if he said to her: \"If you give me two hundred <i>zuz</i> you are betrothed to me with this denar,\" and then he handed her the denar; the condition is void because he did not double it [by stating both alternatives and their consequences]; for he did not tell her: \"If you will not give me the amount you will not be betrothed.\" Hence, she is betrothed immediately, and does not have to give him anything.",
            "Similarly, if he said to her: \"If you will not give me two hundred <i>zuz</i> you will not be betrothed to me, and if you will give me two hundred <i>zuz</i> you are betrothed to me with this denar,\" and he handed her the denar; the stipulation is invalid because he stated the negative before the affirmative. Accordingly, she is betrothed immediately without being required to give him anything.",
            "So too, if he said to her: \"If you will ascend to heaven or descend to the bottom of the ocean you are betrothed to me with this denar, but if you will not ascend to heaven or descend to the bottom of the ocean you will not be betrothed,\" and then handed her the denar; the condition is void and she is betrothed immediately, because it is known that she cannot perform this stipulation; he merely meant to divert her with jesting words.",

            "There are some recent Geonim who have stated that a man does not have to double his condition anywhere except in divorce and betrothal cases; he is not required to do so in civil cases. But this opinion should not be relied upon, seeing that the rule about doubling the condition along with the three other restrictions have been derived by the sages from the condition that Moses stipulated in addressing the Israelites concerning the Gadites and the Reubenites: \"If the Gadites and the Reubenites cross the Jordan … you shall give them the land of Gilead … but if they do not cross over with you…\" (Numbers 32:29-30). This condition had nothing to do with divorce and betrothal occasions. Hence, the early great Geonim ruled as stated previously, and we should act accordingly.",
            "If a man has betrothed a woman conditionally, her betrothal will be valid from the moment the condition has been fulfilled, and not from the time she became betrothed. Example: A man said to a woman: \"If I will give you two hundred <i>zuz</i> this year, you are betrothed to me with this denar; and if I will not give you, you shall not be betrothed.\" He handed her the denar on <i>Nisan</i>, and gave her the two hundred <i>zuz</i>, which he had stipulated with her, on <i>Elul</i>. Then her betrothal becomes valid beginning with <i>Elul</i>. Accordingly, if someone else betrothed her before the fulfillment of the condition made by the first man, she is betrothed to the second man. The same law applies to divorce cases as well as property rights. At the moment the condition is fulfilled, the divorce takes effect, the bargain or the gift becomes valid.",
            "This rule applies only where there was a condition and the man did not say <i>from now</i>. If, however, he said to her: \"You are betrothed to me with this denar from now if I will give you two hundred <i>zuz</i>,\" and after some time he gave her two hundred <i>zuz</i>, her betrothal is valid retroactively from the moment the betrothal was contracted, even though his condition became a reality after a long period only. Accordingly, if a second man betrothed her prior to the fulfillment of the condition, her betrothal is not binding. The same rule applies to divorce and property cases.",
            "Anyone who says <i>from now</i> does not have to double his condition or to express the condition before stating the act; even if he has stated the act first, his condition is valid. Nevertheless, the condition must be possible of performance; if he has made a condition that is impossible of fulfillment, he is regarded as if he used diverting speech, so that no condition exists.— —"
