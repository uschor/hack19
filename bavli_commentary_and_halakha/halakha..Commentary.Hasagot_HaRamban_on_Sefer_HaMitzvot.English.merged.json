            "I come with my wish to learn from those who have come before, to confirm their rules, and to wear them as adorning jewels; but I shall not be a dumb mule and carry their books like a fool. I shall explicate their methods and assess their worth. But if my thoughts cannot abide them, I shall humbly take issue with them, and judge as my eyes are given to see, with the clear legal vision given to me. I shall not show favoritism to received teaching. For God grants wisdom in all ages and days, and withholds not grace from those who walk in God's ways. "

                "We were commanded when we besiege a city, to eat from the tree upon its borders all the days of the siege. And if we cut them for no reason in the way of destructiveness, we would transgress a positive commandment, on top of the explicit negative commandment about it. And He, may He be elevated, stated it, \"as you may eat from it\" - [as] a positive commandment - \"but you may not cut it down\" - [as] a negative commandment. And it is fitting for [Rambam] to count also this, according to his calculation of the commandments. And you should know that this commandment - in both its positive and its negative [forms] - is when we besiege the city to fight against it, to snatch it. As we were commanded to be concerned about it the way we would be concerned about our own, [since] perhaps we will conquer it. But upon our leaving the land of the enemy, we destroy and wreck every good tree. Likewise during the days of the siege, it is permitted to hurt the people of the city by the destruction of the trees so that they will not live off of them. The Torah only forbade its destruction for no reason..."

                "The second mitzvah [that the Rambam‏ ‏‎“forgot” to include in his Book of‎‏ ‏Mitzvot] is that we have ‎been warned to‏ ‏never forget standing at Har Sinai, and‏ ‏to never remove this event from our‏ ‏consciousness. Rather, our eyes and our‏ ‏hearts should be directed there all of the‏ ‏days. It is as the ‎Exalted One said, “Be‏ ‏careful, and guard your soul greatly, lest you forget the things that your eyes ‎saw‏ ‏and lest they leave your heart all the‏ ‏days of your life. And you shall make‏ ‏them known to ‎your children and their‏ ‏children - the day that you stood before‏ ‏Hashem your G-d at Chorev,‎‏ ‏etc.” ‎‎(Devarim 4:9-10).‎‏ ‏The intent in this [commandment] is of tremendous importance. For if the words ‎of Torah were to come upon us only from the mouth of the prophet, peace be upon him, then ‎even if his prophecy was demonstrated to us to be truthful with signs and with wonders, if at some ‎later point in time a prophet or dreamer would arise and command us to do something which was ‎against the Torah, providing signs and wonders [to support his words], the Torah would be ‎removed by the second [prophet], or [at the very least] an uncertainty could enter our hearts over ‎this issue.‎‏ ‏However, once the explanation of the Torah arrived to our ears from the Mouth of G-d ‎and our eyes saw that there was no intermediary, we will refute any who argue or present doubt ‎and we will demonstrate his falseness. Signs won’t benefit him, nor will any wonder save him from ‎our hands. For we will recognize and testify to his falsehoods and recklessness. This is the meaning ‎of the statement regarding the gathering at Sinai, “And in you [Moshe] they shall always believe.” ‎‎(Shemot 19:9). This is[also] the meaning of the passage, “If a prophet or dreamer shall rise up ‎amongst you etc.” (Devarim 13:2). The master [Rambam] has already explained his in the Book of ‎Knowledge (The Foundations of the Torah, Chapter 8). And this is a critical foundation of the Torah ‎and is the prohibition that comes to us from the verse, “lest you forget the things that your eyes ‎saw.” It is a warning lest they leave your heart, such that you will not don’t convey them to your ‎children and their children through all of the generations.‎"
