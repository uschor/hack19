            "Four guardians have been mentioned in the Torah, but only three rules govern their liability. The four guardians are: 1) the gratuitous guardian 2) the borrower, 3) the paid guardian, and 4) the hirer.",
            "The three rules that govern their liability are:<br>a) A gratuitous guardian from whom the deposited object was stolen or lost, and needless to say if it was overcome by a major accident, as in the case of an animal that dropped dead or was carried off, may take an oath that he had guarded it properly and be free from liability, as it is written: \"When a man gives money or goods to another for safekeeping, and they are stolen from the man's house … the owner of the house shall depose before the judges (Exodus 22:6-7).<br>b) A borrower must make restitution in every case, whether the object borrowed was lost or stolen or overcome by a major accident, as when a borrowed animal dropped dead or was injured or carried off. Concerning the borrower it is written: \"When a man borrows [an animal] from another, and it was injured or died, its owner not being with it, he must make restitution\" (13).<br>c) A paid guardian and a hirer are both subject to one rule. They are obligated to make restitution if either the hired object or the deposit for a fee was stolen or lost. But if something worse happened [through a superior force], as in the case of an animal that dropped dead or was injured, carried off, or torn by beasts, the paid guardian or the hirer may take an oath that the animal met with an accident and be released from liability, as it is written: \"When a man gives to another a donkey, an ox, a sheep or any other animal to guard, and it dies or is injured, or is carried off, with no witness about, an oath before the Lord shall decide between the two of them\" (9-10). It is written moreover: \"But if it was stolen from him, he shall make restitution to its owner\" (11).<br>Hence it follows that the gratuitous guardian clears himself by his oath in all cases; the borrower pays in all cases, except in the case of an animal that died from work, as will be explained ; the receiver of a fee and the hirer pay for what is lost or stolen, but they take an oath about the major accidents, namely about the injured or captured or dead or torn animal; or in a case where the object was lost in shipwreck or was taken by armed robbers; and so too, all similar major accidents.<br>3. When a man gives something to another for safekeeping, whether gratuitously or for a fee, or if he lent or rented it to him, the guardian is free from all responsibility if he borrowed or hired the services of the owner. Even if he was negligent with regard to the safekeeping of the object and it was lost through his fault, he is not answerable, as it is written: \"If its owner was with it, no restitution need be paid; but if it was hired, he loses the hiring fee\" (14).— — This [biblical verse] has been traditionally interpreted to mean that if the lender was with the borrower at the moment of the borrowing, though he was not with him at the time of the theft or the death of the animal, the borrower is exempt. But if the lender was not with the borrower at the moment of the borrowing, even though he was with him at the time the animal died or was carried off, the borrower is liable. The same rule applies to all other bailees: they are exempt if the owners were present, even in a case of negligence.",
            "One who deposits [property] with his fellow - whether for free, or the owner paid the bailee, or the owner lent it to him, or he rented it out to him - if the bailee also took the owner for free along with his property - or hired [the owner for money] - the bailee is completely exempt from all [loss to the property]. As it is said: \"If [the property's] owner is with it, he need not pay; if [the property's owner] is a hired worker, [the risk of damage to his property] is included in his wage\" (Exodus 22:14). In what circumstances does this apply? When the owners volunteered or were hired at the same time as [the bailee] took the object, even if the owner was not with the object at the time of the theft or the loss or when the [object was lost through] force majeure. But if [the bailee] took the object - and first became a bailee - and only afterwards hired the owners or had them volunteer - even if the owner is standing there at the time when the deposited object is harmed - the [bailee] must pay. As it is written \"If its owner is not with it - [the bailee] must pay.\" (Exodus 22:13). They learned from tradition: If [the owner] was with it at the time of borrowing, even though he was not there at the time of the theft or the death - [the bailee] is exempt. If [the owner] was not with it at the time of borrowing, even though he was with it at the time of death or capture - [the bailee] is liable. And this is the case for the other [types of] bailees. If any of [the objects] come with their owners - [the bailees] are exempt. Even if [the bailee] is negligent - if the object came with its owner, [the bailee] is exempt.",
            "If a bailee was at fault at the beginning, even though the object was - in the end - lost through <i>force majeure</i>, [the bailee] may be liable, as will be explained. And the borrower is not permitted to lend [what he borrowed] to a third party. Even if he borrowed a Torah scroll - where everyone who reads from it performs a <i>mitzvah</i> - he may not lend it to a third party. Likewise, the renter is not permitted to rent out [the object] [to a third party]. Even if [the owner] rented a Torah scroll to him, he may not rent it to a third party, for [the owner] can say to [the bailee]: I don't want my deposit to be in the hands of a third party. If the bailee transgresses and passes the [object] to a second bailee - if there are witnesses that the second bailee exercised the ordinary care of bailees and [the object was lost through] <i>force majeure</i>, the first bailee is not liable - because there are witnesses that [the loss occurred through <i>force majeure</i>. But if there are no witnesses there, the first bailee has to pay the owner, because he passed [the object] to another bailee. And [the first bailee] may recover from the second bailee. Even if the first bailee was an unpaid bailee and he passed [the object] to a paid bailee - [the first bailee is] liable, because the object's owner can say to him: I trust you to take an oath, but I don't trust [the paid bailee's oath]. Therefore, if the owner habitually deposits this object with the second bailee, the first bailee is not liable to pay, because he can say to the owner: this object that you deposited with me or lent to me last night - you used to deposit it with this person with whom I deposited it. But this is only in a case where [the bailee] does not reduce the duty of care. What is a case of reducing the duty of care? If it was deposited with him for money, and he deposited it with the second [bailee] without payment, or if he had borrowed the object, and he deposited it with the second [bailee] for money. Since [the first bailee] lowered the duty of care, he is at fault and he pays [the owner]. Even if [the first bailee] acquired the services of the object's owner for free or by paying [the owner], he has removed the deposited object from his possession to the possession of a different bailee [and must repay the owner]."

            "When a person hires workers and the workers hoax the employer or the employer hoaxes the workers, all they have is complaints against each other. When does the above apply? When the workers did not go to the appointed place. Different rules apply, however, if donkey drivers went to the appointed place and did not find any grain, workers went to a field and found that the ground was wet, or the employer hired workers to irrigate his field and they discovered that it was filled with water. If the owner checked the area that required work on the previous evening and saw that the workers were necessary, the workers are not entitled to any reimbursement. What could the owner have done? If, however, he did not check the land where he wants the work to be performed beforehand, he must pay them as an idle worker. For a person who comes carrying a burden cannot be compared to someone who comes empty-handed, nor can a person who performs labor be compared to someone who does not. When does the above apply? When they did not begin doing work. If, however, the worker began doing his work different rules apply. A worker may quit his work even in the middle of the day. This is derived from Leviticus 25:55: \"The children of Israel are servants to Me\" - i.e., to Me alone. They are not servants to servants. What is the law that applies to a worker who quits after having started work? We evaluate the work that he performed and he is paid that amount. If he is a contractor, we evaluate the work that still must be performed. Whether the price of labor was low at the time he was hired or it was not low, whether it was reduced afterwards or whether it was not reduced, we evaluate the work that must be performed. What is implied? A person agreed to harvest standing grain for two selaim. He harvested half of the grain, but left half unharvested. Similarly, a person agreed to weave a garment for two selaim. He wove half of the garment, but left half unwoven. If the remainder would cost six dinarim to complete, the original contractor is paid a shekel or he is given the option of completing his work. If the remainder was worth only two dinarim, the owner need not pay the contractor more than a sela, because he did not perform more than half the work. When does the above apply? With regard to work that does not involve an immediate loss. If, however, the work involves an immediate loss - e.g., he hired the workers to remove flax from the vat, or he hired a donkey to bring flutes for a funeral or for a wedding or the like - neither a worker nor a contractor may retract unless he is held back by forces beyond his control -e.g., he became ill or a close relative died. If the worker is not held back by forces beyond his control, and he retracts, the owner may hire others on their account or deceive them.What is meant by deceiving them? He tells them: \"I agreed to pay you a sela; take two so that you will complete your work.\" Afterwards, he is not required to give them anything more than he originally agreed. Moreover, even if he gave them two, he can compel them to return the additional amount. What is meant by hiring others on their account? He hires other workers who complete their task so that he will not suffer a loss. Whatever he must add to pay these later workers beyond the amount the first workers agreed upon, he may take from the first workers. To what extent are the first workers responsible? For their entire wage. Moreover, if they have property that is in the employer's possession, the employer can use that property to hire workers to complete their work until he pays each worker 40 or 50 zuz a day although he originally hired the worker at three or four zuz. When does the above apply? When there are no workers available to hire at the wage to be paid the original workers. If, however, such workers are available and the original workers tell the employer: \"Go out and hire from these to complete your work so that you will not suffer a loss,\" whether a worker or a contractor is involved, the employer has only complaints against them. To determine the wage that should be paid, we follow these guidelines: For a worker, we calculate the work he already[ performed and for a contractor, we calculate the work that must be performed.",
            "When a person hires a worker, but [the worker is then taken to perform the king's service, the worker need not be paid for a full day's work. Instead, the employer should pay him only for the work he performed.",
            "The following rules apply when a person hires a worker to irrigate his field from a particular river, and that river dried up in the middle of the day. If the river does not ordinarily dry up, the workers need only be paid for the work they performed. Similarly, if the inhabitants of the city frequently dam the river, and they stop its flow in the middle of the day, the workers need only be paid for the work they performed. The rationale is that the workers know the pattern of this river. If, however, the river often dries up on its own accord, the employer must pay the workers their entire wage. For it was his responsibility to inform them. If a person hires workers to irrigate a field and it rains and completes the watering of the field, the workers need only be paid for the work they performed. If a river rises and irrigates the field, they should be paid their entire wage. From heaven, they were granted help. When does the above apply? With regard to a worker. Different rules apply, however, when a person stipulates with a sharecropper that if he waters a field four times a day, he will receive half the crop, in contrast to other sharecroppers who water the field twice a day and receive a fourth of the crop. If rain comes and he does not have to draw water to irrigate the crop, he still receives half the crops, as he stipulated. The rationale is that a sharecropper is considered to be a partner, not a worker. ",
            "The following rules apply when a person hires a worker to perform work for an entire day and he completes it in half the day. If the employer has another task that is as - or less - difficult, he may have the worker perform it for the remainder of the day. If he does not have a task for him to perform, he should pay him as an idle worker. When the worker is one who digs, labors in the field or performs heavy labor of this nature and hence will become ill if he does not work, the employer must pay him his entire wage even if he is idle.",
            "When a person hires a worker to bring him an object from one place to another, and the worker goes to the designated place but cannot find the object specified, the employer is obligated to pay him his entire wage. If a person hires a worker to bring rods to use as supports for a vineyard, but the worker can not find them, and hence does not bring them, the employer must pay the worker his wage. If he hired him to bring cabbage or prunes for a sick person, the worker went and when he returned, the sick person either died or recovered, the employer should not tell the worker: \"Take what you brought as your payment.\" Instead, he must pay him the entire wage he promised him. Similar principles apply in all analogous situations.",
            "When a person hires a worker to perform work in his own field, but shows him a field belonging to a colleague and has him perform work there, he must pay him his entire wage. Afterwards, he may require his colleague to reimburse him for the benefit he received from this work.",
            "When a person hires a worker to work together with him with straw, stubble and the like, he is not given the option of telling the worker: \"Take what you did as your payment.\" If, however, he made such an offer, and the worker agreed, he is not given the option of changing his mind and telling the worker: \"Take your wage and I will take my straw.\"",
            "An ownerless object discovered by a worker belongs to him. This law applies even when the employer told him: \"Work for me today.\" Needless to say, it applies if he told him: \"Hoe for me.\" If, however, he hired him to take possession of ownerless objects - e.g., a river dried up and he hired him to collect the fish in a nearby marsh -whatever he finds, even a wallet filled with silver coins, belongs to the owner."

One must pay on time not only the hire of a human being but also the hire of an animal and the hire of implements. If one put off the payment, he has transgressed a prohibitive command.— —",

A hireling for the night collects all day, and about him it is written: \"You must pay him his wages on the same day\" (Deuteronomy 24:15). A hireling by the hour during the day collects all day; a hireling by the hour during the night collects all that night ; a hireling by the week, by the month, by the year, by a seven-year period, collects all day if his term ends in the daytime; if his term ends in the night, he collects all that night.",

            "If a man said to his agent: \"Go and hire workers for me,\" and the agent told them: \"The employer is responsible for your wages,\" neither of them transgresses the law against withholding overnight: the employer, because he did not hire them ; and the agent, because they did not work for him. If, however, the agent did not say to them: \"The employer is responsible for your wages,\" the agent commits a transgression if they are not paid on time. The hirer commits a transgression only when the employee has asked for the wages and he has failed to pay. But if the employee has not asked to be paid, or if he did ask and the employer did not have the money to pay, or if he gave the employee a draft on another person and the employee accepted it, the employer is free from liability [if the employee fails to collect the draft within the set time].",
            "If a man withheld the wages of an employee until after it was due, he must pay him immediately even though he has already transgressed a positive as well as a negative command.

            "If an employee that was hired in the presence of witnesses demanded his wages within the set time and the employer told him : \"I have given you your wages,\" while the employee claimed: \"I have received nothing,\" then, by an enactment of the sages, the employee should take an oath while holding a sacred object in his hand, and collect what he claims, as in the case of any claimant who swears and collects, because the employer is preoccupied with his workmen [and may have forgotten to pay], while the employee sets his heart upon this wage. Even if the employer is a minor, the employee takes an oath and collects.<br>If, however, the employer hired the man in the absence of witnesses, he is believed when he says: \"I have hired you and paid your wage,\" since he could say: \"Nothing of the sort, I have never hired you.\" The employer therefore takes a rabbinic oath of exemption that he has paid, or a biblical oath if he admitted part of the claim, as in the case of all other lawsuits.<br>If the employee had one witness that the man hired him, he is of no help to him. So too, if the employee asked to be paid subsequent to the time when the wage was due, even though he had been hired in the presence of witnesses, [the rule applied to him is that] the man who claims anything from another must bring proof. If the employee has produced no evidence [that he had been asking for his wage ever since it had become due], the employer takes a rabbinic exemption oath. If, however, the employee has produced evidence that he had been demanding the wage all the time, he takes an oath and collects the same day of his demand. If, for example, he worked for the employer on a Monday until evening, payment is due throughout the night preceding Tuesday, but he cannot take an oath and collect on Tuesday. If, however, he has brought witnesses that he had been demanding his wage throughout the night preceding Tuesday, he takes an oath and collects throughout Tuesday. But from the night preceding Wednesday and thereafter, the rule is applied: the man who claims anything from another must produce proof. So too, if he has brought witnesses that he had kept demanding his wage until Thursday, he takes an oath and collects throughout Thursday.",

If he has brought no evidence, the employer takes an oath while holding a sacred object, even though he has already given him two <i>zuz</i> or told him: \"Here they are.\" This rule is by rabbinic enactment, so that the employee should not walk away discouraged. This applies only where the hiring took place in the presence of witnesses who did not know how much the employer agreed to pay to the employee, who demanded his wage within the set time. If, however, he was hired in the absence of witnesses, or if he demanded his wage after the time it had become due, let the employer take an exemption oath that he did not agree to pay the employee more than what he has already paid him, or that he owes him no more than what he has offered to pay, as is the rule regarding all claims.",

He may claim it for all it is worth as his payment. But if the garment is out of his possession or if he has no <i>ḥazakah</i> (right of possession) in it and cannot claim that he has acquired it by purchase, [the rule applied is :] the man who claims anything from another must produce evidence. If he has not produced evidence, the owner of the garment takes an exemption oath, or a biblical oath if he has admitted part of the claim, as is the rule in all claims. The law of a hired man is not applicable to such a case.",

The court should open proceedings by saying to him: \"Do not grieve; take an oath and collect.\" Even if his wage was only a penny, and the employer claims <i>I have paid it</i>, the hired man can collect only by oath. So too, all the claimants who take an oath and collect cannot collect even a penny without a quasi-biblical oath [while holding a sacred object]."
