            "It is a positive command to set apart every male firstborn, whether among human beings or among clean cattle or among the donkey species, whether they are unharmed or diseased, as it is written: \"Consecrate to me every firstborn, man or beast; every firstborn among the Israelites is mine\" (Exodus 13:2). All these belong to the priests.",
            "The firstborn of a human being and the firstborn of a donkey must be redeemed, and their redemption price is given to the priests. The firstborn of clean cattle is to be slaughtered in the Temple Court, like other things holy in a minor degree.— —",
            "If the firstborn of a clean animal was blemished, it had to be given to the priest, whether it was blemished from birth or it became blemished after it had been perfect. If the priest wanted to, he might eat it anywhere, sell it, or serve it as food to anyone he pleased, even to a non-Jew, since it was permissible for common use.— —"

            "A sheep that gave birth to offspring similar to a goat, or a goat that gave birth to offspring similar to a sheep, it is exempt from firstborn laws, as it says (Numbers 18, 17): \"Just the firstborn of an ox\", only when it is an ox and its eldest son is an ox. And if it had some signs of its mother it is a firstborn and it is permanently blemished for there is no blemish greater than change of its species. Even a cow that gave birth to offspring similar to a donkey, and it has some signs of a cow, it is a firstborn for the priest because the laws of firstborn apply to donkeys. But if it gave birth to [offspring similar to] a horse or a camel, even if it has some signs of a cow, it is a doubtful firstborn and therefore may be eaten by the owners. And if the priest seized it, we don't take it from him [the priest]."

            "If a man had ten lambs and he set apart one of the ten, or if he had a hundred and he set ten apart as tithe, they are not valid tithe. But how should one act? He must gather all the lambs or all the calves into the fold and make an opening so small that two cannot get out at the same time. Their dams are left outside bleating, so that the lambs hear their voice and leave the fold to meet them, as it is written: \"All that passes under the shepherd's staff\" (32), meaning that each must pass under the staff of itself, and not that the owner should pull it out. When they emerge from the fold, one after the other, the owner begins to count: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and the lamb which comes out tenth, whether male or female, unblemished or blemished, he marks with red paint and says: \"This is tithe.\"— —",
