            "According to biblical law, it is forbidden to rob the smallest quantity. It is prohibited to rob or defraud even a heathen, an idolater. If a man did rob or defraud him, he must make restitution.",
            "Who commits robbery? One who takes a man's property by force, as when he snatches an object from his hand or enters his premises without permission and takes utensils, or seizes his servant and animal and makes use of them, or enters his field and eats its products, or commits anything of the sort; he is deemed a robber, in the sense that it is written: \"He snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand\" (II Samuel 23:21).",
            "Who commits fraud? One who has come into possession of another person's money with the consent of the owner and detains it by force, and does not return it when the owner demands it. Such is the case if one has a loan or wages due him, and he claims it from the debtor but cannot obtain it from him because he is a violent and difficult man. Relative to this it is written: \"You shall not defraud your fellow man\" (Leviticus 19:13).",
            "Anyone who commits robbery must return the very object he robbed, as it is written: \"He shall restore what he took by robbery\" (Leviticus 5:23). If, however, the object is lost or altered, he must pay its value. Whether he has confessed of his own accord, or witnesses have testified that he committed robbery, he is required to repay the capital value only. Even if he took a rafter by robbery and built it into a structure, inasmuch as it underwent no change, biblical law requires that he shall pull down the whole building and give back the rafter to its owner. The sages, however, have ruled for the benefit of repentant sinners, that he may repay its value and does not have to demolish the structure. The same is applicable to all similar cases. Even if one took a rafter by robbery and used it for the <i>sukkah</i>, and the owner came to claim it during the <i>Sukkoth</i> festival, he has to repay only its value. But if it is claimed after the festival, he must return the rafter itself, inasmuch as it has not been altered and he has not built it in with mortar.",

Accordingly, if he has returned it to the minor in whose hand it was, or to the servant, and it has been lost or broken, he must pay for it. So too, in all similar cases.",

But whenever he takes from one person alone in a manner that does not conform to a known law, but rather seizes the property from the person arbitrarily, it is considered to be robbery. Therefore, the king's dues collectors and his officers that sell fields with a defined tax on the fields, their sale is valid. But a personal tax is only collected from the person himself, and if they sold the field with a personal tax, behold this is not a valid sale unless the king has decreed that it is.",

When the king's coins are accepted throughout those lands [under his control], for the residents of that country have agreed to him and have accepted that he is their master and they are to him as slaves. But if his coins do not circulate, he is like a robber by force and like a band of armed thieves whose laws are not enforced, and such a king and all his servants are considered thieves in all matters."

Because he sells land that is not his, he sells it for some twenty-five percent less, and this quarter belongs to the original owner; it is sold cheaply because it is his. Accordingly, anyone who buys from the oppressor for thirty must give the owner ten, or a quarter of the land, and then he acquires title to all the rest.
