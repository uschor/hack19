                "Anyone who benefits from this world without a blessing is as if they are robbing the Holy Blessed One and the Congregation of Yisra'el. It appears [correct] in my eyes that above [i.e., earlier in the Talmud {Berakhot 35a}], it had said \"[one who benefits from this world without a blessing] has cursed and [nonetheless] benefited from the holinesses of the heavens\" referring to the food itself that one has eaten without a blessing. But, here, [the Talmud] is speaking about the sparks of holiness that are inside the food, and, since [the eater] did not bless [the food] in order to repair [the broken, fallen holy sparks] and to raise them up, [the eater] caused the shell [of the universe's impurity/evil] to rob [the holy sparks], and therefore, the reading of this is \"as if\" the [non-blessing-reciting] eater themselves robbed. And since these sparks of holiness belong to the Holy lessed One, therefore, [Rabbi Chanina bar Pappa] said, \"[Anyone who benefits from this world without a blessing] is as if they are robbing the Holy Blessed One and the Congregation of Yisra'el.\" And therefore, this is similar to Yorov'am who corrupted, and this [non-blessing-reciting eater] corrupted the sparks of holiness that are destined to be oppressed in that shell."
