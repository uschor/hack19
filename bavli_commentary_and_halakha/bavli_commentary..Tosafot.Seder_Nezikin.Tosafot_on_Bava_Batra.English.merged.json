                "They collect according to the wealth of each individual: Since there is no life-threatening danger, we do not assess according to wealth. And this is also true in the last chapter of Bava Kamma (116b): A caravan traveling in the desert, and a troop of bandits stood over it, we assess according to wealth, for there is not danger to life since in the troop is attacking only for money. And even though it says in Sanhedrin (72a) that a tunneling thief is judged according to his end. And Rava explains that this is because there is an assumption that a person would not stand by idly while his money is threatened [and therefore, the fact that the homeowner would defend himself will lead the thief to respond with violence...thus a thief coming to steal money is prepared to act violently] even so, we assess [the caravan attacked by bandits] according to wealth, sinc the bandits only want to seize money, and if the caravan does not defend itself, they bandits will not physically harm them. Therefore, this is not considered a situation of danger. But in the case of bandits, if the caravan comes to terms with them, the amount is assessed by wealth. But when people get lost in the wilderness, it says there that the assessment is per capita, since when people get lost, there is danger to life. "

Since we concluded in the tractate of Holiday Offerings (page 10A) that oaths can be annuled from the pasuk \"that I swore in my anger\" (psalms 95:11) the Gemarah explains that one can annul it for oneself. \"Since I swore in my anger, I can nullify the vow (ibid.).\" We see from here that one can annul one's own vows. However, this doesn't make sense because it says \"One can't go back on one's word.\" (Numbers 30:3) We learn from here that even a scholar can't go back on his own vow (tractate of Promises page 21B). It says in chapter four of the tractate of Promises (page 23A) that there was a launderer who dissolved his vow, but this doesn't mean that he dissolved it himself. Rather that he found a way for its dissolution that was then carried out by the Rabbinic authorities."

                "But here there is no possibility of repentance. And this is said specifically regrading the sexual sins that lead to no mamzer, but one who has intercourse with a married woman and gives birth from her, or from one of the other forbidden close relations, this is \"a crooked thing cannot be made straight\" (Eccl. 1:15) as it is said (Yevamot 21a) regarding teshuvah 'and behold Rabbi Chayim says that even though what is crooked cannot be made straight it is possible to do teshuvah as commanded by God, Who has commanded him to do teshuvah and sincerely repent, but a robber, whose teshuvah is dependent on returning what was stolen, as it is written \"and he returns what he stole, etc.\" (Lev. 5:23), how can one who stole from the public know exactly from whom he has stolen to return [the property]? And even though it is said 'let him pay with [the stolen goods] the needs of the community' (Baba Kamma 94b) in any instance it is not complete teshuvah."
