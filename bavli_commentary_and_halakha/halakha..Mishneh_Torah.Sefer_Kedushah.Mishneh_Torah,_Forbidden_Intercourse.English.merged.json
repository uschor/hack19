            "Similarly, you find that in some places--and you find [this also supported by] responsa of some Geonim--that a woman who gives birth to a male should not have sexual relations until the end of the forty [days after birth], or until the end of the eighty [days after birth] for a woman who gives birth to a female, even though she saw blood only in the seven days [after giving birth]. This custom is just an error in those responsa and [this practice] is [an act of] heresy in those places. They learned this practice from the <i>Tzadokim</i>. It is a <i>mitzvah</i> to compel them to remove [this practice] from their hearts and to return them to the words of the Sages who [required that] she should count only seven \"clean\" days, as we explained."

This is also explained by Ezra, “We will not give our daughters in marriage to the peoples of the land, or take their daughters for our sons.” (Nehemiah 10:31) ",

When one comes to convert from being a Gentile and they examine him and they do not find any ulterior motive, they say to him: What did you see that made you want to convert? Don't you know that Israel in these times is rejected, swept away, disturbed, and afflictions come on them. If he says, \"I know, and I am not worthy\" they accept him immediately. ",

And they inform him of some of the lenient commandments, and some of the stringent commandments. And they do not dwell at length on this. And they let him know the sin of “gatherings” “forgotten sheaves” “corners of the field” and “second tithe.” And they tell him of the punishments for not keeping the commandments. How so? They say to him: Know that before this point, if you ate forbidden fate, you would not be punished with karet, if you broke Shabbat, you would not be punished by being stoned. But now, after you have converted, if you eat forbidden fat you will be punished with karet, if you break Shabbat, you will be punished by being stoned. And they do not dwell at length on this, nor do they go into detail, lest this causes him to be troubled and turn away from the good path to the evil path. For at the beginning we do not draw a person except with words of appeasement and gentleness.  I drew them with human ties, with cords of love. ",
            "And just as they inform them of the punishment for keeping commandments so too they inform them of the reward of mitzvoth, and they inform them that by doing these mitzvoth they will earn the world to come, and that no one is perfectly righteous person except for one who is a master of wisdom, who performs these commandments and knows them. ",
            "And they say to him: Know that the world to come is hidden only for the righteous, and this is Israel. And the reason that Israel is in pain in this world, it is a good hidden for them for they cannot accept too much goodness in this world, like the other nations, lest they get haughty, and go astray and they lose the reward of the world to come, as it says, \"So Jeshurun grew fat and kicked.\"",
            "And God does not bring on them an abundance of punishment so that they will not be lost. Rather, all of the nations of the world are finished off, and they will remain. And they go on at length about this matter, in order to endear it to them. If he retracts and does not want to accept, he can go on his way. And if he accepts, they do not delay him. Rather they circumcise him immediately. And if he was already circumcised they spill some covenantal blood, and they delay him until he fully heals, and then they immerse him. "
