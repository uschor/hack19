            "It is a positive commandment to mourn for one's closest relatives, as it is said (Lev 10:19) \"...had I eaten sin offering today would the Lord have approved.\" And mourning is not based on Scripture except for the first day only because it is the day of the death and the day of the funeral. But the rest of the seven days are not torah-mandated, even though it says (Gen 50:10) \"...and he mourned for his father seven days.\" - when the Torah was given the law was renewed. And Moses our teacher established the seven days of mourning and the seven days of celebrating for Israel.",

            "When a person commits suicide [kills oneself with clarity of mind], we do not engage in activity on their behalf at all. We do not mourn for him or eulogize him. We do, however, stand in a line to comfort the relatives, recite the blessing for the mourners and perform any act that shows respect for the living. What is meant by a person who commits suicide? Not necessarily one who climbs up on a roof, falls, and dies, but rather, one who says: \"I am going up to the top of the roof.\" If we see him climb up immediately in anger or know that he was distressed and see him fall and die, we presume such a person is one who committed suicide. If, however, we see him strangled and hanging from a tree or slain and lying on the back of his sword, we presume that he is like all other corpses. We engage in activity on his behalf and do not withhold anything from him."

            "It is permissible for a priest to become impure through walking through a beit hapras or the diaspora for the sake of a mitzvah, when there is no way other than that, e.g., he went to marry or to study Torah. Even though there is someone who could teach him in Eretz Yisrael, he is permitted to leave, because a person does not merit to learn from every colleague.Similarly, a person may incur ritual impurity that is Rabbinic in origin to show respect to other people. What is implied? If a mourner walked through a beit hapras, everyone follows after him to comfort him. Similarly, we may walk over the coffins of the dead to greet Jewish kings. This is allowed even to greet gentile kings, so that a distinction will be able to be made between them and Jewish kings when their glory will return to its place. Similarly, leniency is granted in all analogous situations. Also, a priest may incur ritual impurity of Rabbinic origin to enter in judgment and disputation with gentiles concerning property, for he is saving it from their hands. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations."

It is written: \"She shall mourn her father and mother for a full month\" (Deuteronomy 21:13). Hence, a mourner ought to grieve throughout thirty days.",
            "Following are the things which a mourner must not do during the thirty days: he must not take a haircut, wear ironed clothes, get married, attend a social festivity, travel from one town to another on business—a total of five things."

            "Funeral rites are held in honor of the deceased. Accordingly, the heirs are compelled to pay a fee to wailing men and women who eulogize the dead. But if the deceased charged in his will not to eulogize him, he should not be eulogized. If, however, he charged in his will not to bury him, his wish is not heeded, because burying the dead is a religious duty, as it is written: \"You must bury him\" (Deuteronomy 21:23).",
            "Anyone who is too indolent to mourn for a scholar will not enjoy longevity; anyone who is too indolent to mourn for a worthy man deserves to be buried alive. Anyone who sheds tears for a worthy person, there is a reward in store for him with God."

He who grieves too much over what is bound to happen is a fool. What measure of mourning should one follow? Three days for weeping, seven for lamenting, thirty days for abstaining from a haircut, and the rest of the five things."

            "It is a rabbinic positive precept to visit the sick, comfort the mourners, escort the dead, dower the bride, accompany the [departing] guests — — as well as to cheer the bride and the groom, and to assist them in whatever they need. Even though all these precepts are of rabbinic origin, they are implied in the biblical verse: \"You shall love your neighbor as yourself\" (Leviticus 19:18); that is, whatever you would have others do to you, do to your brothers in Torah and precepts.",
            "The reward for escorting a stranger is greater than any reward. It is a practice introduced by our father Abraham, a way of kindness which was habitual with him. He served food and drink to wayfarers and escorted them. Hospitality to wayfarers is greater than welcoming the Divine Presence, as it is written: \"He saw three men … he ran to meet them\" (Genesis 18:2). Escorting them is even greater than receiving them. The sages have declared: \"Anyone who does not escort his guests is almost guilty of bloodshed\" (Sotah 46b).",
            "Local residents are compelled to provide escorts for wayfarers just as they are compelled to contribute to charity. The court used to provide agents to escort any person who would pass from one locality to another. Those who shirked this duty were regarded as if they shed blood [because of the dangerous roads]. Even if one accompanies another the distance of four cubits, he will be amply rewarded.— —",
            "The duty of visiting the sick applies to everybody. Even an eminent person must visit one who is of minor importance. The visits should be made several times a day. The more often one visits the sick, the more praise he deserves, provided that he does not weary the patient. Whoever visits a patient is as though he took away part of his illness and lightened his pain. Whoever does not visit the sick is almost guilty of bloodshed.",
            "A sick person should be visited only from the third day on. If his illness came on suddenly and his condition has become worse, he should be visited immediately. A patient should not be visited either during the first three hours or the last three hours of the day, because he is being attended to at the time.— —",
