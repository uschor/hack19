            "<b>All those occupied with Torah and acts of kindness and who pray, etc.</b> These three are the three pillars of the world, that we taught in a mishna \"On three things the world stands: on the Torah, on the Service, and on acts of kindness\" (Pirkei Avot 1:2). And this was at the time that the Temple stood, but now that the Temple is not standing, communal prayer is in the place of communal [sacrificial] service, i.e. the Tamid offerings which were brought every day. And the Holy Blessed One says, [this person has] redeemed Me and My children, etc. (Berachot 8a) -- for God's Presence is in exile, as it was written \"I will be with him in distress\" (Psalms 91:15). And also with all of the 30 \"psalms of David\" they said this pasuk, see there. God's Presence says, \"He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle [קרב] against me\" (Psalms 55:19), this is the language of those who are close [קרובים], that is to say my children. \n"
