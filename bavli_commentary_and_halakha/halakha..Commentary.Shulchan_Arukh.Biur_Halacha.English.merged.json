They are: Tosfos and the Rosh that while it stands the condition doesn't help, when it is destroyed it does.  Rashi and the Ohr Zaruah that even while standing it helps.  The Ramban, the Ran, and the Rashba hold that even in it's destruction it doesn't help unless it is a difficult situation, but in such a situation, even while standing it helps.  [Difficult situation is like needing to feed poor people at that time or let them sleep there].  Even though the Michabeir took the opinion that while standing it doesn't help, in any case, it seems from the Taz that you could rely on the Ramban that even while it stands the condition helps.  And the law is with him since that is also the opinion of the Ran and the Rashba and you can also combine them with the opinion of Rashi and the Ohr Zarua that hold even while it stands it helps.  You should also know that even according to Rashi and the Ohr Zarua that it helps even while it is standing, for full fledged frivolity like scoffing and joking etc, it is obvious that it doesn't help as the Gemara says explicitly.  See there that it says even calculations are forbidden since those are also called frivolity."
