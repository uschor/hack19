            "You asked, How was the Mishna written? Did the Men of the Great Assembly begin writing it and the sages of each successive generation added a little to it until Rebbi came and sealed it? [This would be reasonable] Since most anonymous statements are [Rebbi's] and [all] anonymous Mishnayot are Rabbi Meir's. [Additionally,] most of the sages that are mentioned in the Talmud are Rabbi Meir, R' Yehuda, R' Yosei and R' Shimon; all of them were students of R' Akiva. [Furthermore, drawing from] the principals that our sages of blessed memory taught us in the Talmud (that the law follows R' Akiva over his colleague, R' Yosei over his colleagues and Rebbi over his colleague) all of [these Rabbanim lived] at the end of the Second Temple. ... Why did the earlier Rabbanim give up most [of the Mishna] to the later [Rabbanim]? This could only be true if none of the Mishna was written until the end of Rebbi's life. ... Furthermore, if the orders [of the Mishna] were organized according to the order of the Tractates, why did they do it [?chronologically?] this way? Why did they precede Yoma to Shekalim, Sukkah to Haggigah and both of them to Rosh Hashana? [This question applies to] any tractate that is not ordered with its fellow [?chronologically?]. ... Furthermore, [regarding] the Tosefta [is it like what] we heard that R' Hiah wrote it after the sealing of the Mishna or [was it written] at the same time as [the Mishna]? And why did R' Hiah write it? If [R' Hiah] make [the Tosefta] as additional things that explain the topics of the Mishna, Why did Rebbi leave them and not write them? Isn't [the Tosefta] said in the name of the sages of the Mishna? ... Also the Braitot, how were they written? Also the Talmud, How was it written? Also the Rabbanan Savorai, How did they edit [the Talmud] after Ravina. Who ruled [i.e. ran the Yeshiva] after them? How many years did they rule from that time until now?         "
