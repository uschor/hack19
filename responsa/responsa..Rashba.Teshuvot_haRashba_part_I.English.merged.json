            "...Regarding the question of an animal which suffers a wound which would be considered a treifa, and behold, it lives more than 12 months, should we say that since it lived more than a year, the wound was not in fact a treifa - and thus the animal should be considered kosher? My answer is, if you have seen or heard of someone who is lenient in such a case, do not listen to them! Anyone who is would claim that this animal is kosher is, in my eyes, as one who is insulting the words of the Sages.... everyone who is truly God-fearing must be as a firm wall against this, and not to make the words of the Sages like a broken and pierced wall, through which the fox enters...",
            "..And if you will reply, \"what can we do? We have seen with our own eyes a wounded animal in this manner who nevertheless lived 12 months?!\" We consider this as one who testifies on the impossible. We would ask them, \"how do you know for certain that this is the same animal? Perhaps you forgot or made a mistake?\" For it is impossible that the same animal would live for 12 months with a treifa. "

            "Regarding biblical   law,   we   follow   the stringent  position,  as  [the  existence  of multiple  views  is  like  having]  a  doubt concerning a biblical law. Regarding rab-binic  law,  we  follow  the  lenient  position, as is found in the first chapter of Avodah Zarah (7a). One who relies on the lenient position   regarding   biblical   law,   trans-gresses.  He  is  among  those  about  whom it  is  said  “its  stick  directs  it”  (Hoshea 4:12), as  we  have  said.  However,  if  there is  a  rabbi  in  their  place  who  has  taught them, they follow his words. This is [seen in the case of] the difference between the land  of  Israel  and  the  land  of  Bavel  re-garding  a  certain  fat  on  the  innards –these  prohibit  eating  it and those  permit it. One may even eat it in secret in Bavel, if  he  plans  on  returning  to  be  counted among  the  people  of  his  place  [Israel], even though it is a biblically forbidden fat according to those in Bavel. ",
            "In Rabbi Eliezer’s region, they would cut wood  [on  Shabbat]  to  make  charcoal  to make  the  knife  [for  circumcision],  and the  sages  did  not  protest  as  they  were acting   like   their   teacher.   And   in   the chapter Kol HaBasar (Chullin Chapter 8, 116a)  it  says,  “Levi  visited  the  town  of Yosef Rishba. They served a head of fowl cooked in  milk. He did not  eat,  and  said nothing. When [Levi] returned to Rav, he said,  “Why  didn’t  you  excommunicate them?!” He replied, “That is the town of Rabbi  Judah  ben  Beteira.  I  thought  per-haps  he  expounds  like  Rabbi  Yossi  the Galilean’s  opinion,  who  says  ‘poultry meat is excluded [from the prohibition of meat  and  milk]  for  it  does  not  produce milk.’”  And  so  too  in  many  cases.  In  a similar   way,   people   who   have   accus-tomed  themselves  based  on  one  of  the great  authorities,  [such  as]  the  places where  they  act  in  all  their  actions  based on  the  laws  of  Rif  z”l,  and  the  places where  they  always  act  based  on  Ram-bam’s code -they have made these great ones their teachers. However, if there is a sage worthy of ruling, and he sees a proof to  forbid  what  they  permitted,  he  can forbid  it,  for  this  [deceased  figure]  is  not actually their teacher, and if they were to act  differently  than  their  actual  teacher in  his  place,  it  would  be  lessening  the honor of their teacher in his place... In a place  where  there  are  two  equal  ones,  they  follow  the  strict  one  regarding  biblical law, but only if it is one against one. However, it if is two against one, we follow the majority. And if a student worthy of issuing halachic rulings agrees with the posi-tion of the lenient one, perhaps they may follow his leniency because he agrees with the ruling of the lenient one and then it is majority against an individual."

            "There is another matter to scrutinize from the words of Maimonides, who wrote (Moreh Nevukhim 3:37): “They stated explicitly: ‘anything that has medicinal properties does not constitute Emorite ways.’  That is, anything that is derived by natural reason is permitted, and anything else is forbidden.”",
            "I ask as one who is skeptical of Maimonides’s words: What is that thing that Maimonides would call “derived by natural reason”? Does this mean that it was derived by the study of those sages who composed books about nature, such as Aristotle, Galen, and their peers, who composed books on the nature of effective remedies and medicaments based on their studies, and that anything not attained by their studies is included in the prohibition on Emorite ways? Is it because the study of these sages’ efforts in the science of nature incorporates every natural phenomenon according to its nature? Are these sages the culmination of all possible natural inquiry? This, in truth, is unreasonable. For in truth, the things that work magically do not work by means that are external to them. Rather, their nature is magical, that is, their nature cannot be understood through the inquiry of wise men, perhaps even the wisest of all sages, due to the scope of nature’s concealment from the human race because of its very humanness. An example is the magic of a magnet, to which iron jumps. More than that, it is customary among seafarers to stick a pin through a piece of wood floating on the surface of the water and bring it close to a magnet, and then it will glide over the surface of the water until it points toward the pole; then it will stop. No sage among these sages of the science of nature can comprehend this by studying nature. Therefore, any object in nature with magical properties also functions like medicaments and remedies, and their use is not considered the ways of the Emorites, just like those well-known substances whose efficacy is based on the natural studies of those sages. Moreover, perhaps their studies have yet derived what has been derived from the studies of the wisest man (=King Solomon) to write a medical treatise: “He spoke of trees, from the cedars of Lebanon to the hyssop in the wall” (1 Melakhim 5:13). If so, who should we forbid that which they say comes from magical nature? Perhaps it has been derived from the study of the wisest man even though it has not derived from the studies of one of these sages of nature.",
            "I further question as one who is skeptical of Maimonides’s words about that which is stated by Abaye and Rava (Hullin 78), “anything that has medicinal properties does not constitute Emorite ways.” Did they say “anything that has medicinal properties only according to the studies of those sages who composed treatises on nature”? Anything not attained by their studies is forbidden? If so, what is the novelty of what Abaye and Rava said? There is an explicit verse in Scripture, “he shall surely be healed,” from which we derive that physicians may practice medicine. Why did the Talmud cite the statement of Abaye and Rava in context of a passage, which discusses matters that constitute the ways of Emorites?",
            "In truth, it seems obvious in context that they permitted even medicine that is not derived from these sages’ study of nature. King Solomon, who composed a medical treatise, was not, God forbid, following the ways of the Emorites. The book was hidden away by Hezekiah, and the rabbis praised him for it, not because it went in the ways of the Emorites, but because the wisest of men, in his great wisdom, composed a book on substances that are very effective, from the realm of revealed nature as well as magical nature. Ultimately, the world relied upon them in their illness, and in their illnesses they did not seek out God. Therefore, he hid it, and the rabbis conceded to him. This is similar to the verse (2 Divrei Hayamim 16:12): “Even in his (=King Asa of Judah) illness he did not seek out God, but only physicians.” Therefore they hid [the book], but they did not burn it, because it does not constitute the ways of Emorites, although he pulverized the copper snake.
